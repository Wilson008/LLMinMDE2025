abstract = {Recent trends suggest that Chinese herbal medicine formulas (CHM formulas) are promising treatments for complex diseases. To characterize the precise syndromes, precise diseases and precise targets of the precise targets between complex diseases and CHM formulas, we developed an artificial intelligence-based quantitative predictive algorithm (DeepTCM). DeepTCM has gone through multilevel model calibration and validation against a comprehensive set of herb and disease data so that it accurately captures the complex cellular signaling, molecular and theoretical levels of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). As an example, our model simulated the optimal CHM formulas for the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) with depression, and through model sensitivity analysis, we calculated the balanced scoring of the formulas. Furthermore, we constructed a biological knowledge graph representing interactions by associating herb-target and gene-disease interactions. Finally, we experimentally confirmed the therapeutic effect and pharmacological mechanism of a novel model-predicted intervention in humans and mice. This novel multiscale model opened up a new avenue to combine “disease syndrome” and “macro micro” system modeling to facilitate translational research in CHM formulas.}

abstract = {Source variables or observable properties used to describe agroecological experiments are heterogeneous, nonstandardized, and multilingual, which makes them challenging to understand, explain, and use in cropping system modeling and multicriteria evaluations of agroecological system performance. Data annotation via a controlled vocabulary, known as candidate variables from the agroecological global information system (AEGIS), offers a solution. Text similarity measures play crucial roles in tasks such as word-sense disambiguation, schema matching in databases, and data annotation. Commonly used measures include (1) string-based similarity, (2) corpus-based similarity, (3) knowledge-based similarity, and (4) hybrid-based similarity, which combine two or more of these measures. This work presents a hybrid approach called Matching Agroecological Experiment Variables (MAEVa), which combines well-known techniques (PLMs, multi-head attention, TF–IDF) tailored to the challenges of aligning source and candidate variables in agroecology. MAEVa integrates the following components: (1) Our key innovation, which consists of extending pretrained language models (PLMs) (i.e., BERT, SBERT, SimCSE) with an external multi-head attention layer for matching variable names; (2) An analysis of the relevance and impact of various data collection techniques (snippet extraction, scientific articles) and prompt-based data augmentation on TF–IDF for matching variable descriptions; (3) A linear combination of components (1) and (2); and (4) A voting-based method for selecting the final matching results. Experimental results demonstrate that extending PLMs with an external multi-head attention layer improves the matching of variable names. Furthermore, TF–IDF benefits consistently from the presence of an enriched corpus, regardless of the specific enrichment technique employed.}

Conventional approaches to failure effects analysis in reactor protection systems encounter notable challenges, including labor-intensive manual analysis and limitations in ensuring comprehensive analysis coverage. To tackle these issues head-on, we introduce a novel methodology termed Failure Effects Analysis on Safety Properties (FEA-SP). Grounded in model checking technology, this method facilitates automated failure analysis processes. By harnessing the exhaustive state space exploration capabilities inherent in model checking, the FEA-SP methodology adopts the safety properties of the system as its granularity and verification focal point. A detailed component-level case study involving a hard logic within the HPR1000 nuclear reactor protection system underscores the efficacy and practicality of the proposed approach, especially in the thorough examination of system spurious actions. The failure effects analysis method delineated in this paper holds broad applicability and serves as a valuable reference for the analysis of failure effects in safety systems.}

This study aims to determine the impact of potential non-industrial demand-side-management technologies, including heat pumps, controlled charging of battery electric vehicles, refrigeration, and air conditioning, on energy costs and battery storage requirements in Germany's future electrical power system. The model is analyzed using a novel modeling approach that enables a comparison of flexible loads responding to different market conditions: centralized market conditions with uniform market prices and decentralized market conditions with nodal prices, considering the congestion management potential of demand-side-management. The results show that non-industrial flexible loads can significantly affect the need for battery storage if high residual load peaks can be reduced by the specific technology. However, energy costs may only be reduced by up to 10 %. The study emphasizes the potential of demand-side-management for mitigating grid congestions, demonstrating that investment in battery storages may be lowered by up to 40 % when comparing centralized and decentralized market conditions.}

However, existing research has largely focused on the operational cost benefits associated with workload transfer, neglecting its impact on the workloads themselves. To fully investigate the potential of workload transfer for sustainable and positive development in data centers, this study firstly clarifies the interaction between workload and energy. Based on this, an integrated management framework is proposed to simultaneously optimize workload transfer and energy dispatch. A transfer model that considers workload heterogeneity is developed to capture the characteristics of workload transfer and is integrated with the energy system model, enabling cross-sectoral collaboration between Information Technology (IT) and energy sectors. A case study in Shanghai reveals a clear trade-off exists between workload transfer and energy dispatch. The results show that while transferring workloads can reduce operational costs by 7.63 % in summer and 2.81 % in winter, it concurrently increases the average delay rate of workloads by 0.2434 in summer and 0.2028 in winter. The impact of workload transfer on energy systems is not always positive and a sole focus on cost reduction could result in an elevation of the average delay rate. Additionally, the driving forces behind workload transfer include variations in electricity prices, excess renewable energy and optimal operation of the energy system. The structure of workload also significantly affects the workload transfer. Overall, this study integrates modules from both the IT and energy sectors to achieve holistic management of data centers. The results of the case study provide novel and valuable insights for optimizing the operation of data centers during workload transfer processes.}

abstract = {The coastal region of Fujian contains numerous existing stone masonry structures, many of which are constructed on soft soil sites. Previous studies have shown that the soil-structure interaction (SSI) effect on soft soil foundations can prolong the structure's natural vibration period and enhance its seismic response. We develops a soil-structure interaction system model and a comparative rigid foundation model using the finite element software LS-DYNA to investigate the impact of SSI on the dynamic characteristics and seismic response of stone structures. The results indicate that the SSI effect alters stone structures' dynamic properties and seismic response. This alteration is evident in the extended natural vibration period, which reduces overall stiffness, increases interstory displacement angles, and slightly decreases the acceleration response. Under both SSI and FIX systems, the structural failure mode is characterized by the external collapse of the second-story stone walls, which causes the roof stone slabs to lose support and fall, leading to overall collapse. The FIX system demonstrates better structural integrity and stability with slower crack development. In contrast, the SSI system exhibits cracks that appear earlier and develop more rapidly, causing more severe damage. The research findings provide a theoretical basis for the seismic reinforcement of existing stone structures on soft soil foundations.}

abstract = {Background
Panic disorder (PD) is a chronic and impairing anxiety disorder. Individuals with more sleep disturbances might be predisposed to nine-year PD chronicity. However, linearity assumptions, small predictor sets, and analytic and design limitations have hindered optimal identification of which sleep disturbance variables are distal risk factors for PD chronicity. We thus used machine learning (ML) to predict nine-year PD chronicity using high-dimensional data.
Method
Community-dwelling adults (N = 1054) completed clinical interviews, self-reports, and seven-day sleep actigraphy at Wave 1 (W1) and the same clinical interview at Wave 2 (W2) nine years later. The baseline data comprised 43 actigraphy, self-reported sleep disturbances, clinical, and demographic variables. Seven ML models were examined. Gradient boosting machine (GBM) was the best-performing algorithm. PD chronicity was defined as the presence of a PD diagnosis at both W1 and W2.
Results
The GBM accurately predicted PD chronicity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] =.764). Shapley additive explanation analysis showed that the top W1 predictors of PD chronicity were comorbid major depressive disorder, low healthcare utilization, sleep medication use, lengthier wake after sleep onset, and sleep-wake circadian disruptions based on actigraphy and self-reports. Lower household income and younger age were also top predictors. Additionally, the final multivariate model was well-calibrated.
Conclusions
As proposed in our sleep-panic nexus theory, actigraphy and subjective sleep disturbances have essential prognostic value in predicting long-term PD chronicity. Harnessing ML facilitates accurate prediction by identifying complex, nonlinear relations across high-dimensional datasets, possibly improving prevention and treatment tailoring.}

abstract = {Background
Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling condition, affecting approximately 280 million people globally. Emerging evidence points to a significant role of neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of depression. The soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (sTREM2) has been identified as a potential marker of neuroinflammation.
Objective
This study aims to investigate the potential mediating role of sTREM2 in the relationship between perceived stress, measured by the List of Threatening Events, and current depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive episodes (MDE).
Methods
This secondary analysis was conducted on data from a multicenter, case-control study of participants with current MDE (n = 39) and healthy controls (HC, n = 42). Plasma sTREM2 levels were measured using bead-based multiplex assays. Depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and Life-Threatening Events (LTE) were quantified with the Stressful Life Events Scale. A mediation analysis was conducted to explore the role of sTREM2 in the relationship between depression and LTE.
Results
Patients with current MDE exhibited higher plasma sTREM2 levels compared to HC (p = 0.006). Recent stress was positively associated with sTREM2 (p = 0.032), and both LTE scores and sTREM2 levels were significant predictors of current MDE (p = 0.009, p = 0.035). Mediation analysis showed that sTREM2 accounted for 17 % of the relationship between recent stress and depression (p = 0.028).
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that sTREM2 may play a mediating role in the link between stress and depression, highlighting neuroinflammation as a potential pathway in the development of depression.}

abstract = {Context:
Due to the proliferation of generative AI models in different software engineering tasks, the research community has started to exploit those models, spanning from requirement specification to code development. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a paradigm that leverages software models as primary artifacts to automate tasks. In this respect, modelers have started to investigate the interplay between traditional MDE practices and Large Language Models (LLMs) to push automation. Although powerful, LLMs exhibit limitations that undermine the quality of generated modeling artifacts, e.g., hallucination or incorrect formatting. Recording modeling operations relies on human-based activities to train modeling assistants, helping modelers in their daily tasks. Nevertheless, those techniques require a huge amount of training data that cannot be available due to several factors, e.g., security or privacy issues.
Objective:
In this paper, we propose an extension of a conceptual MDE framework, called MASTER-LLM, that combines different MDE tools and paradigms to support industrial and academic practitioners.
Method:
MASTER-LLM comprises a modeling environment that acts as the active context in which a dedicated component records modeling operations. Then, model completion is enabled by the modeling assistant trained on past operations. Different LLMs are used to generate a new dataset of modeling events to speed up recording and data collection.
Results:
To evaluate the feasibility of MASTER-LLM in practice, we experiment with two modeling environments, i.e., CAEX and HEPSYCODE, employed in industrial use cases within European projects. We investigate how the examined LLMs can generate realistic modeling operations in different domains.
Conclusion:
We show that synthetic traces can be effectively used when the application domain is less complex, while complex scenarios require human-based operations or a mixed approach according to data availability. However, generative AI models must be assessed using proper methodologies to avoid security issues in industrial domains.}

abstract = {The severity of major depressive disorder (MDD) is crucial in guiding treatment decisions for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), particularly given the high relapse rates post-ECT. Maintenance-ECT (M-ECT) has emerged as a key strategy to prevent relapse, with recent trends favouring symptom-driven approaches. This study explores the use of self-report scales as an adjunct to clinician-rated assessments in M-ECT decision-making, focusing on the Clinician-Rated 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C) and its self-report version (IDS-SR). In the Preventing Relapse After Successful ECT for Depression (PRASED) study, a subsample of 96 MDD patients were included upon achieving remission after an acute ECT course. Patients were stratified into relapse potential categories based on weekly IDS-C scores, determining the need for zero, one, or two M-ECT sessions the following week. Using five monthly IDS-C and -SR, the scales demonstrated good to excellent agreement, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.73 to 0.85 at multiple timepoints during M-ECT. Notably, 81 % of decision-making outcomes were concordant. Also, 16 % would result in patients receiving more ECT sessions based on the IDS-SR than the IDS-C, highlighting some overestimation by self-report scores. These findings indicate that self-assessment of depression severity by IDS-SR is a reliable alternative for clinician-rated measurements during M-ECT. Hence, this reduction of resource burden by self-report could facilitate the widespread implementation of personalised M-ECT, which may improve patient outcomes by reducing relapse rates in MDD. Future research should focus on validating self-report measures as reliable alternatives to clinician assessments in M-ECT to optimize treatment personalization and efficiency.}

We harnessed data from three installments of the MIDUS Longitudinal study (n = 7108). A Marginal Structural Model facilitated the investigation of associations between a history of cancer diagnosis, MDD, and potential modifying effects of education level. Inverse probability weighting helped manage confounding factors.
Results
Findings indicated that a cancer diagnosis made one year prior was linked with 3.741 times greater odds of experiencing MDD (95 % CI: 1.411–9.918, p < 0.01). This connection was absent for diagnoses made two years earlier. Among individuals with education up to high school, a recent cancer diagnosis significantly increased the likelihood of MDD in the subsequent wave by 3.45 times (95 % CI: 1.31–9.08, p < 0.05). This pattern was not apparent among better-educated individuals.
Limitations
As the exposure variable was dependent on self-reported questionnaires, recall bias could be a potential limitation. Moreover, unaccounted variables like genetic factors could introduce confounding.
Conclusions
A recent cancer diagnosis, particularly among less educated individuals, correlated with an increased probability of MDD, while the impact was not observed for older diagnoses. These findings emphasize that the timing of a cancer diagnosis and education level need consideration in the mental health assessment of cancer survivors.}

Large Language Model (LLMs) revolutionize natural language process (NLP) but face challenges in domain-specific applications due to specialized terminology and context. Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants for industrial-related work enquiry and customer support services are necessary for increasing demand and quality of service (QoS). Our research aims to design a novel customized model with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based LLM as a sustainable solution for industrial integration with AI. The goal is to provide an interactive industrial knowledge management (IIKM) system that can be applied to technical services: assisting technicians in the search for precise technical repair details and company internal regulation searches: personnel can easily inquire about regulations, such as business trips and leave requirements. The IIKM model architecture consists of BM25 and embedding sequence processing in the chroma database, where the top k-chunks are selected by the BAAI ranker to respond effectively to the queries. A group of documents of 234 MB size and pdf, pptx, docx, csv and txt formats are used for the experimental analysis. The designed interactive knowledge management system has a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 88 %, a recall of 85 % and a mean average precision (mAP) of 75 % in technical service. The internal regulatory documents have a generation-based retrieval evaluation prediction of recall of 91.62 %, MRR of 97.97 % and mAP of 91.12 %. We conclude with insights gained and experiences shared from IIKM deployment with Sakura incorporation, highlighting the importance of the hybrid approach integrating RAG-based generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models for customized solutions.}

abstract = {Model-based virtual sensing offers a viable approach for monitoring fatigue loads on operational offshore wind turbines. These methods combine response measurements with first-principle, or data-informed models, to estimate load time series at hard-to-access locations. However, their accuracy depends on the fidelity of the underlying model, which is largely influenced by uncertainties in the soil–structure interaction (SSI) models. This study evaluates the impact of different SSI modelling approaches in terms of a virtual sensing validation study targeting strain estimation above and below the mudline of a bottom-founded offshore wind turbine. To this end, different numerical models derived from, and validated against, design documentation serve as input to a dual-band modal decomposition and expansion (MDE) method. The considered SSI models range from an API/DNV-based foundation model to a PISA-based model including scour protection. Virtual sensing results are generated for two-year equivalent datasets, obtained for three operational offshore wind turbines, each equipped with extensive load monitoring systems. One turbine is used to assess the effect of the model updates, while two additional turbines are used to assess the across-site consistency. The estimated strains are directly compared against available strain validation data, in terms of damage-equivalent stress, and are accumulated to give a single comparative metric representative for the two-year periods. Results show that PISA-based soil reaction curves significantly improve agreement with measured strains while adding a scour protection model has a relatively smaller impact. These findings highlight the importance of accurate foundation modelling in virtual sensing and demonstrate the feasibility of fatigue monitoring at hard-to-access locations.}

Among various mathematical and dynamic models used for GRN reconstruction, S-system model, comprising non-linear differential equations, is widely utilised to capture the behaviour of complex biological systems with non-linear and time-dependent interactions. However, as the network size increases, computational demand for network inference grows due to a greater number of estimation parameters, significantly impacting the performance of optimisation algorithms. Incorporating biologically relevant prior knowledge using advanced Natural Language Processing methods can effectively address this limitation by reducing the need for computing large parameters, thereby enhancing speed and accuracy. In this study, we introduce PRESS, an integrated Prior Knowledge Enhanced S-system model for accurate GRN reconstructions, which seamlessly automates the incorporation of prior knowledge obtained through systematic extraction from published literature. PRESS exploits our recently reported BioBERT-based Gene Interaction Extraction Framework with enhanced targeted genetic relation extraction and the prediction of regulatory genes. Effectiveness of the optimisation algorithm in learning model parameters is further enhanced through a novel fitness evaluation, which limits the maximum number of regulatory genes to mimic real GRNs. This integrated method, combining a robust relation extraction framework for automated prior knowledge with a GRN reconstruction model, is novel and has not been reported previously. Experimental results obtained using Escherichia coli subnetworks and the benchmark SOS dataset demonstrate substantial reductions in computational cost while simultaneously improving prediction accuracy.}

However, over-parameterization of these models often increases the risk of overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose a Transformer model based on tensor train networks. Initially, we propose a tensor train layer (TTL) to accommodate the original weight matrix, thus reducing the space complexity of the mapping layer. Based on the TTL, we reconfigure the multi-head attention module and the position-wise feed-forward network. Finally, a tensor train layer replaces the output layer to complete the overall compression. According to the experimental results, the proposed model compresses SRSs parameters effectively, achieving compression rates of 76.2%−85.0%, while maintaining or enhancing sequence recommendation performance. To our knowledge, the Tensor Train Transformer is the first model compression approach for Transformer-based SRSs, and the model is broadly applicable.}

It is rapidly advancing in all sectors of society. Researchers have shown that it is a multidimensional process determined by human decisions based on ideologies, ideas, beliefs, goals, and the ways in which technology is used. In health care and health, the end result of digital transformation is digital health. In this study, a detailed literature review covering 560 research articles published in major journals was performed, followed by an analysis of ideas, beliefs, and goals guiding digital transformation and their possible consequences for privacy, human rights, dignity, and autonomy in health care and health. Results of literature analyses demonstrated that from the point of view of privacy, dignity, and human rights, the current laws, regulations, and system architectures have major weaknesses. One possible model of digital health is based on the dominant ideas and goals of the business world related to the digital economy and neoliberalism, including privatization of health care services, monetization and commodification of health data, and personal responsibility for health. These ideas represent meaningful risks to human rights, privacy, dignity, and autonomy. In this paper, we present an alternative solution for digital health called human-centric digital health (HCDH). Using system thinking and system modeling methods, we developed a system model for HCDH. It uses 5 views (ideas, health data, principles, regulation, and organizational and technical innovations) to align with human rights and values and support dignity, privacy, and autonomy. To make HCDH future proof, extensions to human rights, the adoption of the principle of restricted informational ownership of health data, and the development of new duties, responsibilities, and laws are needed. Finally, we developed a system-oriented, architecture-centric, ontology-based, and policy-driven approach to represent and manage HCDH ecosystems.}

abstract = {Monocular depth estimation (MDE) seeks to infer pixel-wise dense depth maps from a single RGB image. Recent methodologies predominantly utilize the encoder-decoder architecture to effectively extract and analyze multi-scale features. However, they tend to ignore the important role that high-level features with rich global information play in MDE, resulting in a poor understanding of the overall structure of the scene by the model. Based on this, we propose a novel encoder-decoder framework called GRdepth, which includes a cross large scale feature enhancement (CLSE) module and an iterative regulation decoder (IRD). Specifically, the CLSE module is designed to use high-level features, enriched with global information extracted by a global information aggregation (GIA) unit, to guide the enhancement of multi-scale feature maps produced by the encoder. This enhancement is achieved through a cross large scale feature fusion (CLSF) unit built from channel attention and spatial attention to refine low-level features with high-level information. The IRD is tailored for MDE based on classification-regression which mainly utilizes a bin width self-regulation (SRbins) unit to adjust the width of the initial bins predicted with the bottleneck features. This adjustment is guided by bin width predicted by an iterative adaptive feature fusion (IAFF) unit at each level, effectively combining global information and local information for more accurate bin width and bin centers. Extensive experiments on the indoor dataset NYU-Depth-v2 and SUN-RGBD and on the outdoor dataset KITTI demonstrate that our method can achieve comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.}

To optimize key operational parameters—namely, power split ratio, converter duty cycle, and load demand—Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed. This approach significantly enhanced system performance: energy efficiency improved to 88 %, surpassing the baseline range of 78–80 %, and battery state-of-charge (SoC) gain reached 2.4 %, compared to 1.1–1.8 % without optimization. Furthermore, fuel cell degradation was effectively minimized to 0.04, a substantial reduction from 0.1 observed in suboptimal conditions. These results highlight the potential of integrating statistical modeling with bio-inspired optimization techniques to achieve intelligent, real-time energy management in FCHEVs, leading to greater energy utilization, extended driving range, and improved component longevity.}

Tourist congestion is a common issue that can significantly affect service quality. To maintain a high level of service in congested environments, many attractions offer priority services, such as the VIP services commonly offered in malls or amusement parks, which grant priority access to specific customers and allow them to reduce or even eliminate waiting times. By integrating such priority discipline, businesses can enhance the satisfaction of high-priority tourists while improving profitability. In this paper, a new tourist trip design problem that incorporates two priority discipline strategies is introduced, for the first time representing the priority discipline as constraints within the model to ensure that the solutions strictly adhere to the discipline. To address this problem, a branch-and-bound algorithm is proposed for solving small-scale instances, and an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is developed to efficiently handle large-scale instances, with a customized heuristic rule used to determine the visiting orders at each attraction. The effectiveness of both algorithms is demonstrated through experimental results. Finally, parameter analysis is conducted for the model, and several managerial insights are obtained.}

This necessitates the development of advanced modelling methodologies capable of capturing intricate cause-and-effect relationships and interdependencies across systems and subsystems. The Dimensional Analysis and Conceptual Modelling (DACM) framework addresses this need by using directed graphs to represent causal relationships within complex systems. However, while the DACM framework is effective for modelling individual systems, it has limitations when connecting different parts of a system (subsystems) that need to work together. Moreover, the framework requires a mechanism to extract meaningful relationships between variables. To address these limitations, this study introduces new organs derived from bond graph theory, which perform specific functions, enabling effective modelling of interconnected systems. Expert knowledge, combined with the DACM framework, is used to represent systems as collections of functions and to assign appropriate variables to these functions. Relationships between variables are computed as power laws using LASSO and OLS regression algorithms. Unlike previous works, these algorithms rely solely on the fundamental dimensions of variables. In addition to variable assignment, expert knowledge is also used to validate the computed power laws, thus substituting experimental data with expert knowledge. The interaction between the derived dimensionless numbers is represented as a directed graph, capturing the causal relationships between the functions. The approach is demonstrated through a qualitative case study of Gas Metal Arc Welding, illustrating its potential for system modelling, analysis, and using explainable directed graphs for contradiction resolution.}

Neuroimaging evidence suggests the different functional connectivity (FC) of the ID and MDD patients. However, most existing studies rely on static FC analysis, and no direct comparison has been made between ID patients and those with comorbid ID and MDD (IMD). There is rare study to capture the impact of depressive symptoms on the dynamic brain properties of ID patients. To address this gap, the present study used a novel method to calculate the stability of brain dynamic FC (sDFC) based on the sliding window approach. And this method was utilized to compare the dynamic brain properties between ID and IMD patients. Independent samples t-tests identified differences in the sDFC between the ID (n = 47) and IMD (n = 50) groups, and Pearson's correlations examined relationships between sDFC and sleep quality, insomnia symptom severity, and depressive symptoms severity in IMD patients. Results showed increased sDFC in the right supramarginal gyrus and left precuneus in IMD patients, and decreased sDFC in the bilateral putamen, bilateral thalamus, right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and right middle frontal gyrus. In IMD group, sDFC in the left precuneus was positively correlated with depressive symptoms, while sDFC in the right putamen was negatively correlated with insomnia symptoms, and in the left putamen and right SFG, it was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. This study is the first to directly compare dynamic brain properties between ID and IMD patients. The result provides a deeper understanding of how co-occurring depression in ID patients affects brain dynamics. The findings highlight potential target brain regions for future neuromodulation interventions, which could enable more effective and personalized treatments for patients with both ID and MDD.}

However, the scalability and accessibility of existing 3D reconstruction methods are limited by expensive imaging systems and constrained environments. Here we present PlantMDE, the first generalizable monocular depth estimation (MDE) model tailored for plant phenotyping. PlantMDE reconstructs 3D plant structures using only a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-view inputs and enabling cost-effective, scalable, and non-invasive phenotypic analysis on small-scale plants. To address a key limitation of general-purpose MDE models in capturing detailed object geometry, PlantMDE incorporates a novel organ-wise metric to explicitly estimate the 3D morphology of individual plant organs. PlantMDE is trained and evaluated on PlantDepth, a new large-scale plant RGB-D dataset comprising data from eight sources across various plant species and growing conditions. Across multiple evaluation datasets, PlantMDE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MDE models, improving the similarity to the ground truth over Depth Anything and Marigold under both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. Beyond reconstruction, depth features extracted by PlantMDE substantially enhance downstream phenotyping tasks, reducing error by 10.2 %–44.8 % in image-based trait estimation, including plant height, biomass, leaf area, and stress level. These results establish PlantMDE as a generalizable, scalable solution for high-throughput plant phenotyping, with broad implications for precise plant research and agriculture monitoring.}

IRSSRE displays the operational states of IRS through Modelica-based modeling at both the component and system levels, ensuring realistic data interactions and state transitions. It also enhances risk management by modularly designing Risk Trigger Modules that explicitly define potential threats, reducing modeling overheads and facilitating the validation of risk utilization scenarios. The capabilities of IRSSRE are demonstrated by simulating a small-scale IRS and replicating the states of both normal and compromised systems through the analysis of four representative attack types and the comparison of device model state curves. The efficiency and effectiveness of the IRSSRE framework are experimentally evaluated, and a comparative analysis with existing alternatives is performed, further demonstrating IRSSRE’s superior performance with respect to low resource overhead and high scalability. IRSSRE offers significant value through the integration of operational and security attributes, enhanced configurability and validation efficiency enabled by modular risk management, and support for simulation replication and granular state-level threat analysis.

Applying two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to data from available genome-wide association studies in populations of European ancestry, we estimated the causal association between multi-site chronic pain and no pain versus PTSD. Moreover, we used multivariable and mediation MR analysis to assess the mediating effects of 13 lifestyle factors or diseases on the causal relationship between multi-site chronic pain and PTSD. The MR analyses were mainly conducted with the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, followed by various sensitivity and validation analyses.
Results
Multi-site chronic pain dramatically increases the risk of developing PTSD (odds ratio [OR]IVW = 2.39, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.72–3.31, p = 2.10 × 10−7), and no pain significantly reduces the risk of developing PTSD (ORIVW = 0.12, 95 % CI = 0.05–0.30, p = 3.14 × 10−6). Multivariable MR found that 13 potential confounding factors do not influence the causal effect of multi-site chronic pain on PTSD. Moreover, body mass index (BMI) (6.98 %), educational attainment (8.79 %), major depressive disorder (MDD) (36.98 %) and insomnia (27.25 %) mediate the causal connection between multi-site chronic pain and PTSD.
Conclusion
Overall, individuals with multi-site chronic pain may be at a higher risk of developing PTSD, and this risk is partially influenced by the pathways involving BMI, educational attainment, MDD, and insomnia. These factors offer potential targets for therapeutic interventions.}

abstract = {The Austrian government has pledged to achieve climate neutrality by 2040, but so far, there is a lack of consistent net-zero scenarios. Therefore, we integrate a comprehensive stakeholder with a techno-economic modelling process, coupling an energy and a power system model, to co-create qualitative scenario narratives and quantitative model-based scenarios for Austria's energy system, assuming all non-energetic emissions are eliminated. All four scenarios reach climate neutrality by 2040, but differ in terms of energy demand and trade in energy carriers. In the scenario narratives, variations in the local acceptance of renewables and of sufficiency lifestyles explain these differences. All scenario narratives emphasize that commitment of all societal actors is required to reach climate neutrality by 2040. We find that the quantitative model-based scenarios consistently point at far-ranging electrification of transport and heat supply, the buildup of renewables, and a switch in steel producing technology until 2030. Long-term developments are more diverse and show either elevated imports of synthetic fuels or a more pronounced expansion of domestic renewables. Consistently across scenarios, significant fossil fuel infrastructure must be retired before end of life and the required speed of change in energy infrastructure is unprecedented in the history of the Austrian energy system.}

Patients suffering from severe mental disorders have a reduced life expectancy of 10–25 years compared to the general population, mainly due to the presence of physical comorbidities such us metabolic disorders. This study aims to explore the relationship between BMI and several clinical and sociodemographic factors in a sample of patients with affective disorders.
Methods
This is a naturalistic observational multicenter study carried-out in 7 Italian university sites. Patients aged 18–65 years with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD), diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteria, and in a stable illness phase, were recruited. Affective temperaments were assessed with the Munster Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego; impulsivity with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale; suicidal ideation with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale.
Results
A total of 598 patients were recruited. According to the regression analyses, the likelihood of having a higher BMI was increased by a higher trait-related impulsivity (p < 0.05), higher number of lifetime affective episodes (p < 0.05), male gender (p < 0.01), a depressive affective temperament (p < 0.05), use of lithium and of other antiepileptic drugs (p < 0.05). Conversely, a higher educational level reduced the likelihood of higher BMI (p < 0.01).
Conclusion
These findings highlight a strong link between BMI and impulsivity, number of affective episodes, temperament, gender and use of antiepileptics. Their routine assessment would be useful for an early identification of metabolic comorbidities and for the identification of patients at higher risk of having a worse physical outcome.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate whether AI-assisted ipsilateral tissue matching in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) reduces localization errors beyond typical tumor boundaries, particularly for non-expert radiologists. The technology category is deep learning.
Materials and Methods
The study consisted of two parts. In Part 1, 14 radiologists subjectively evaluated the AI tool’s impact on confidence and perceived usefulness on 11 cases. In Part 2, 12 radiologists marked lesion annotations with and without AI assistance after a washout period. Errors were measured relative to 94 consensus reference annotations in 30 cases established by two expert reviewers. Stratifications included expertise, lesion abnormality, and presence of ViewFinder warnings (indicating high uncertainty in the computed mapping). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests assessed statistical significance.
Results
In Part 1, radiologists reported improved confidence and a mean usefulness score of 6.21/10 (p < 0.001), with greater benefit in challenging cases. In Part 2, root mean square error (RMSE) and maximum distance error (MDE) for abnormal lesions were 32 % (11.70 mm vs 8.88 mm) and 37.5 % higher (20.68 mm vs 15.08 mm), respectively, without AI assistance (p < 0.05). Non-expert readers showed the greatest benefit, with RMSE (12.20 mm vs 7.57 mm, p < 0.01) and MDE (15.76 mm vs 9.47 mm, p < 0.05) reduced by over 60 %. These reductions are clinically relevant given typical screen-detected breast tumor sizes (median, 13 mm [IQR: 9–20 mm]).
Conclusion
AI-assisted tissue matching significantly improved localization accuracy, especially for non– expert readers and in complex cases. The AI warning system effectively identified high-uncertainty cases. Errors were reduced to within typical tumor dimensions, potentially preventing missed lesions.}

The proposed factors assess the design quantitatively. SPSysML uses a requirement-based system structuring method to couple simulated and physical parts with requirements. SPSysML-based systems incorporate DTs that perceive exogenous actions in the simulated world. SPSysML validation is survey- and application-based. First, we develop a robotic system for an assisted living project. We propose an SPSysML application procedure called SPSysAP that manages the considered system development by evaluating the system designs with the proposed quantitative factors. As a result of the SPSysML application, we observed an integrity improvement between the simulated and physical parts of the system. Thus, more system components are shared between the simulated and physical setups. The system was deployed on the physical robot and two simulators based on ROS and ROS2. Additionally, we share a questionnaire for SPSysML assessment. The feedback that we already received is published in this article.}

However, planning effective FSMS configurations remains challenging due to fluctuating market demands, heterogeneous system components, complex interdependencies, and the need to optimize resource utilization. Conventional planning methods often require predefined line configurations and lack adaptability, scalability, and awareness of dynamic system properties. This paper presents a novel Hybrid Graph-Diffusion Based Planning Framework that integrates generative AI with system-theoretic modeling to autonomously generate optimal FSMS configurations based on different market demands. Specifically, we introduce a system model-embedded Heterogeneous Graph (HG) to represent the structure and properties of an FSMS and infuse it within a system property-tailored diffusion model to generate reconfigurable plan configurations. The final system property-guided refinement guarantees that the final plan configuration is optimal in both demand satisfaction and resource use. Furthermore, our ablation studies validate that our framework significantly outperforms conventional approaches in both demand satisfaction and resource efficiency. Furthermore, our ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the system property guidance and HG-based representation in enhancing planning feasibility, robustness, and adaptability.}

To better represent the dynamic nature of policy-making, we develop an endogenous institutional model that can be embedded within land system models, here exemplified by an agent-based model. Numerical experiments are conducted to examine an institution with two policies targeting the production of ecosystem services. We find a clear scope for simulation-based exploration of policy-making, with emergent processes including the marginal diminishing effect of economic policy interventions, asymmetric spill-over effects for different ecosystem services, and trade-offs between policy goals. The endogenous institutional model demonstrates the potential to reveal various emergent patterns with important consequences for land systems.}

abstract = {Background
Disease name recognition is a fundamental task in clinical natural language processing, enabling the extraction of critical patient information from electronic health records. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, most evaluations have focused on English, and little is known about their robustness in low-resource languages such as Japanese. In particular, whether these models can perform reliably on previously unseen in-hospital data, which differs from training data in writing styles and clinical contexts, has not been thoroughly investigated.
Objective
This study evaluated the robustness of fine-tuned LLMs for disease name recognition in Japanese clinical notes, with a particular focus on their performance on in-hospital data that was not included during training.
Methods
We used two corpora for this study: (1) a publicly available set of Japanese case reports denoted as CR, and (2) a newly constructed corpus of progress notes, denoted as PN, written by ten physicians to capture stylistic variations of in-hospital clinical notes. To reflect real-world deployment scenarios, we first fine-tuned models on CR. Specifically, we compared a LLM and a baseline-masked language model (MLM). These models were then evaluated under two conditions: (1) on CR, representing the in-domain (ID) setting with the same document type, similar to training, and (2) on PN, representing the out-of-domain (OOD) setting with a different document type. Robustness was assessed by calculating the performance gap (ie, the performance drop from in-domain to out-of-domain settings).
Results
The LLM demonstrated greater robustness, with a smaller performance gap in F1-scores (ID–OOD = −8.6) compared to the MLM baseline performance (ID–OOD = −13.9). This indicated more stable performance across ID and OOD settings, highlighting the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs for reliable use in diverse clinical settings.
Conclusions
Fine-tuned LLMs demonstrate superior robustness for disease name recognition in Japanese clinical notes, with a smaller performance gap. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as reliable tools for clinical natural language processing in low-resource language settings and support their deployment in real-world health care applications, where diversity in documentation is inevitable.}

Yet, their transferability across plants is hampered by scenario differences—variations in environmental factors, protocols, and data distributions—that erode performance and necessitate energy-intensive retraining. While existing strategies focus on minimizing these differences via domain adaptation or fine-tuning, none exploit them as inherent prior knowledge for improved generalization. Here we show an environmental information adaptive transfer network (EIATN) framework that can leverage scenario differences to enable effective generalization across distinct prediction tasks within the same water plant. By evaluating EIATN across four scenario categories and 16 diverse ML architectures—yielding 64 models in total—we demonstrate its feasibility, with bidirectional long short-term memory emerging as the top performer, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of just 3.8 % while requiring only 32.8 % of the typical data volume. In a case study of Shenzhen's urban water system, it reduced carbon emissions by 40.8 % compared to fine-tuning and 66.8 % relative to direct modeling from scratch. EIATN unlocks the reuse of vast existing ML models in water systems, yielding substantial energy savings and fostering equitable, low-carbon intelligent management.}

Formal modeling serves as a unified cognitive approach and a robust foundation for system development. Hence, this paper focuses on the scenario management challenges within the industrial intelligence context and introduces the concept of using formal modeling languages as the foundation for DTs. We propose a model management architecture and a modeling methodology tailored for scenario-specific digital twins and provide a corresponding metamodel for the modeling approach.

These characteristics make it challenging for traditional physical models and data-driven methods to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal convolutional network named ConvDiff, optimized specifically for dynamic system modeling tasks by integrating a latent space denoising diffusion model. ConvDiff effectively captures complex spatio-temporal features and handles uncertainties in physical systems by introducing multi-scale convolutional modules combined with a physics-guided diffusion mechanism. Specifically, our model incorporates eight temporal modules and four spatial modules, using a hierarchical convolutional and diffusion structure to capture the intricate dynamics of physical systems. The experiments involved different spatio-temporal data, such as those from TaxiBJ and the Navier-Stokes dataset. According to the findings, ConvDiff demonstrates substantial improvements in essential performance indicators. For example, in the TaxiBJ dataset, ConvDiff obtained a mean squared deviation of 0.29 and a PSNR value of 40.31, outperforming the best-performing models. Moreover, on the Navier-Stokes dataset, ConvDiff reduced the MSE by 51.15% compared to the best baseline model. These results indicate that ConvDiff effectively captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies and improves prediction accuracy, particularly in physics-driven dynamic systems.Our code is available at https://github.com/Ray-zyy/ConvDiff.}

abstract = {Background
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in neuroplasticity and has been implicated in both the pathophysiology of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and treatment effects. Unlike serum BDNF (s-BDNF), which largely reflects platelet-derived BDNF released during coagulation, whole blood BDNF (wb-BDNF) measures the total blood BDNF pool, minimizing confounds related to platelet aggregation. This study aims to assess whether wb-BDNF levels can serve as a biomarker for MDD and/or as a predictor of antidepressant treatment response.
Methods
We measured wb-BDNF before and after 4–12 weeks of escitalopram intervention in two studies: a non-randomized, single-arm clinical trial of 97 unmedicated patients with MDD and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 66 healthy controls (HC). The BDNF Val65Met polymorphism was also determined.
Results
Unmedicated patients with MDD had 14 % lower wb-BDNF than HC, but wb-BDNF prior to intervention was not associated with symptom severity, nor did it predict drug treatment outcome in the patients. Further, improvements in depression scores after 8 and 12 weeks of escitalopram was not associated with changes in wb-BDNF. In HC, wb-BDNF was similar in the placebo and escitalopram groups after 4 weeks of intervention. BDNF polymorphism was similar between HC and MDD, and responders and non-responders, and was not associated with wb-BDNF levels.
Conclusion
wb-BDNF reflects the total blood BDNF pool and avoids platelet aggregation-related confounds seen in s-BDNF measures. wb-BDNF could be used as diagnosis but not as a prognosis biomarker, in MDD. Further research is needed to investigate changes in BDNF reservoirs and their implications.}

abstract = {Background
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent in youth. Conventional treatment paradigms primarily involve selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and psychotherapy, yet a significant proportion of this population exhibits treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In adults, interventional therapies like Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), and ketamine have shown promise for TRD, but their comparative efficacy remains underexplored in Adolescent and pediatric population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the relative effectiveness of ECT, rTMS, and ketamine in treating TRD among adolescents.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched databases for studies of ECT, rTMS, or ketamine for treatment-resistant depression in youth ages 10–24. Three reviewers independently screened for inclusion based on predefined criteria. Included observational and randomized controlled trials reported depression symptoms with measures like HDRS and MADRS in youth treated with ECT, rTMS, or ketamine. Two reviewers extracted data on interventions, patients, and depression symptom outcomes. Chance-adjusted inter-reviewer agreement was calculated. For meta-analysis, we pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) in depression scores using random effects models and assessed heterogeneity with I2 statistics.
Results
Meta-analysis of 10 observational studies examined SMD in depression scores for treatment resistant depression patients treated with ECT, ketamine, or rTMS. Patients treated with ECT had a significantly lower SMD of 1.99 (95 % CI 0.92–3.05, p < 0.001) compared to baseline. Patients treated with ketamine also had a significantly lower SMD of 1.58 (95 % CI 1.04–2.12, p < 0.001). Patients treated with rTMS had the lowest SMD of 2.79 (95 % CI 0.79–4.80, p = 0.006). There was no significant difference between the three groups overall (p > 0.05). Comparative analysis between ECT and ketamine found no significant difference in SMD (p = 0.387). Comparison of ECT versus rTMS found a significant difference in SMD favoring rTMS (p = 0.004). Comparison of ketamine versus rTMS suggested a potential difference in SMD favoring rTMS (p = 0.058). In summary, rTMS resulted in significantly larger reductions in depression scores than ECT, and potentially larger reductions than ketamine.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis illustrates the ability of rTMS, ECT, and ketamine to improve depression in youth. rTMS resulted in the largest improvements, highlighting its potential as a first-line treatment for pediatric treatment-resistant depression given its favorable side effect profile compared to ECT. Further research directly comparing these modalities is needed.}

This study analyzed pre-existing data to investigate whether speech features extracted from semi-structured interviews with a virtual avatar could enhance traditional diagnostic approaches by utilizing automated voice analysis, which can detect nuances beyond human hearing, potentially improving sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing PTSD. Leveraging the DAIC-WoZ dataset (Gratch et al., 2014), which includes 142 dialogues (average length: 954 s) between participants and a virtual avatar, we extracted content and acoustic features from transcripts and audio recordings. Group comparisons aimed to identify differences between PTSD and non-PTSD participants, as well as distinctions between PTSD participants with and without comorbid depression. Key findings revealed that PTSD participants expressed more negative sentiment in their speech (η²=0.82, p < 0.001) and used less frequent words (η²=0.65, p < 0.001) compared to controls. To demonstrate the utility of speech features, classification models were developed to differentiate PTSD and control participants. A linear model with twenty-one speech features (balanced accuracy = 0.70) outperformed a model based solely on demographic data (balanced accuracy = 0.53). Subgroup analyses found no significant differences in speech features between PTSD participants with and without comorbid depression. These results suggest that automated speech analysis, facilitated by virtual avatars, can identify linguistic markers of PTSD, potentially aiding diagnosis and reducing barriers to disclosure. However, further research is needed to generalize these findings and explore their utility in clinical practice.}

Multiple factors contribute to suicide risk, such as depression and a history of attempted suicide among other biological, psychological, and social factors. Although the examination of suicidality in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) occupies a substantial place in the literature, limited focus has been given to the application of explainable AI for the interpretation of suicide behavior taking into account suicide-related psychological variables. This study explored an ML pipeline via comparative, statistical, and post-hoc analyses to predict suicidal behaviors in patients diagnosed with MDD (N = 273 patients) by identifying specific risk and protective factors linked with clinically significant suicide risk. The results showed that LightGBM classifier presented the best overall performance, reaching 0.895 ROC-AUC score with parameter tuning. High depressive symptomatology from young age, high fear of dependence and interpersonal intimacy as well as interpersonal rejection or abandonment, and previous suicide attempts were identified as risk factors, while access to mental health care services, having a family, and being employed were found to be protective factors. The results showed that a mix of heterogenous factors should be incorporated for better interpreting suicidal behaviors, including psychological factors, such as attachment style, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, explainable AI appears to be a promising means for identifying MDD patients with high risk of suicidality, contributing to tailor-made clinical interventions.}

To address this problem, we propose an alternate training methodology inspired by the forward–forward algorithm originally designed for classification tasks. We extend this concept through a kernel-based modification, enabling its application to regression tasks, which are commonly encountered in process system modeling. Our proposed Kernel-based Forward Propagating Neural Network (K-FP-NN) eliminates backpropagation, using layer-wise updates for better adaptability. We introduce a real-time (RT) updating framework, RT-K-FP-NN, to continuously refine model parameters with new data. Results indicate that when applied to model predictive control of a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system, our approach updates the model within 100 s, achieving better performance metrics compared to backpropagation-based real-time models, which require 326 s. This framework can be applied to various dynamic systems, enhancing real-time decision-making by improving predictive accuracy and system adaptability.}

This paper explores that the large language models can effectively understand depth with minimal supervision, using efficient resource utilization and a consistent neural network architecture. We propose Large Language Model-Monocular Depth Estimation (LLM-MDE), a unified framework that treats depth estimation as a language-reasoning problem. A frozen Vision Transformer first encodes an image; cross modal reprogramming then aligns visual tokens with a small set of learned text prototypes, and an adaptive depth prompt generator turns simple image statistics into natural-language cues that guide a pretrained large language model. Only lightweight Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adaptors are tuned, keeping the computational cost low. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of LLM-MDE, which excels in few/zero-shot tasks while minimizing resource use. These show that large language models, when guided by minimal visual reprogramming and adaptive prompts, can reason about geometric structure without prior vision-specific training, opening a practical path to low-resource MDE on edge devices.

Patients were seen in a specialized outpatient psychiatry clinic within an epilepsy center. Data included Clinical Global Impression–Improvement (CGI-I) ratings by psychiatrists specialized in epilepsy care, seizure frequency, DSM-5-based psychiatric diagnoses, and treatment interventions (e.g., medication adjustments, psychotherapy, and psychosocial support). Patients also completed a self-report questionnaire. No significant difference in MDD diagnoses was found between those with baseline NDDI-E scores of 14–16 and ≥17 (6.7 % vs. 21.1 %, p = 0.36). Comorbidities included autism spectrum disorder, dissociative disorder, and other mental health conditions. Changes in seizure frequency did not correlate with ΔNDDI-E or CGI-I scores, while ΔNDDI-E and ΔItem 4 showed moderate correlations with CGI-I (ρ = 0.51 and 0.56). All patients with improved Item 4 scores had better CGI-I ratings (p < 0.001). Qualitative analysis indicated that emotional fluctuations and psychosocial stressors influenced NDDI-E scores. These results suggest that longitudinal improvement in NDDI-E Item 4 may serve as a marker for psychiatric benefit. Effective use of the NDDI-E requires considering the psychiatric and psychosocial dimensions beyond seizure control. To validate these findings, studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are necessary.}

abstract = {Anxiety and inflammation are complex, interconnected physiological processes. The “Conflict Avoidance Theory of Inflammation-Induced Anxiety” (CATIA) hypothesizes that inflammation-induced anxiety confers an evolutionary advantage by promoting harm-avoidance and recovery-promoting behaviour. Inflammatory cytokines act as signalling molecules to anxiety-related brain regions, primarily limbic structures such as the amygdala, thus influencing decision-making and behaviour. This is archieved by priming these structures for exaggerated fear-responses counteracting conflict engagement, when adaptive physiological readiness is impaired. This adaptive mechanism prioritizes recovery and survival during illness or injury. However, in modern contexts, inflammation driven by lifestyle factors or chronic conditions may perpetuate anxiety symptoms, contributing to psychiatric disorders like generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Understanding the psychoneuroimmunologic underpinnings of CATIA may inform screening, prevention, and treatment strategies for anxiety-associated disorders. Therefore, we propose clinical applications particularly for clearly defined vulnerable populations affected by inflammation-induced anxiety. These vulnerable populations could be detected using a “screening & scoring system”, and personalized treatment options could then be applied according to a defined algorithm. Although the literature widely supports the theoretical background of CATIA, the hypothesis is thus far untested and needs further investigation. We outline specific suggestions how this could be achieved in a clinical context.}

The need for improved therapeutics is urgent. Animal models utilized for drug development are limited by interspecies variability and poor translatability. However, most in vitro models lack the sophistication to model the key interplay of the immune system with the intestinal epithelium in line with the known role of the immune system in the etiology of the disease. To address this gap, we developed a primary intestinal epithelial cell co-culture system to incorporate elements of innate immune signaling. This system models immune-epithelial interactions using RepliGutⓇ - Planar Transverse Colon cultured on a Transwell™ system with THP-1 derived macrophages in a receiver compartment of a 96-well plate format, compatible with high-throughput screening (HTS) workflows. Epithelial barrier integrity and cell viability were maintained in co-culture with unstimulated macrophages. However, similar to the pathology associated with IBD, epithelial integrity was compromised in co-culture with LPS + IFN-γ pre-stimulated macrophages as evidenced by declining TEER and cell viability and increased inflammatory cytokine release. Cotreatment with anti-inflammatory IBD therapeutics adalimumab or tofacitinib mitigated these effects, demonstrating the model’s ability to replicate key inflammatory responses and prevention. Reproducibility and scalability of the model system further position the model for screening and/or mechanistic interrogation of anti-inflammatory drugs, improving drug discovery, and accelerating the translation of new IBD therapies into clinical practice.}

Aluminum foam, characterized by its porous structure achieved through gas addition during production, offers a significantly lower density compared to solid aluminum while maintaining mechanical robustness. This study compares two production systems: one using aluminum powder from primary material and the other utilizing aluminum chips from secondary material. The system boundary includes the manufacturing process from cradle to gate. The environmental impacts of both product systems are analyzed quantitatively, revealing that the aluminum foam sandwiches produced from recycled aluminum exhibit a considerable average reduction of 20.9% in environmental impacts across all assessed categories. In the climate change category, the production using aluminum chips results in a reduction of 13.1% compared to the powder option. Human toxicity (carcinogenic) showed the highest reduction at 40.0%, while ozone depletion had the smallest reduction at 7.1%. The findings highlight processes with high environmental influence, providing approaches for optimizing the environmental impact of aluminum foam. Additionally, the study examines the influence of different system models on the results, contributing to the existing literature on sustainable aluminum production by demonstrating the importance of material sourcing and methodological choices in Life Cycle Assessment.}

abstract = {Background
Although suicidal ideation (SI) represents a critical manifestation associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), existing diagnostic methods remain largely subjective. This study adopted resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques to examine objective neural biomarkers connected to SI in patients with MDD.
Methods
Participants comprised 50 patients with MDD and SI (MDD-SI), 56 patients with MDD without SI, and 55 healthy control individuals (HCs), matched by demographic variables. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) analyses were conducted to characterize brain activity patterns. The detected neural features underwent independent clinical correlation and support vector machine (SVM) analyses to evaluate their clinical and diagnostic relevance.
Results
In MDD-SI subjects, elevated fALFF was observed in the middle frontal and right postcentral gyri, with a marginal increase in the left hippocampus. They exhibited unique hyperactivation in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as measured by ReHo, distinguishing them from patients with HCs and MDD without SI. Among individuals in the SI group, left hippocampal fALFF exhibited a significant negative association with depression severity scores (p < 0.05). The SVM classifier reached 63.81 % accuracy in distinguishing MDD-SI individuals from HCs based on ReHo in the right lateral OFC.
Conclusion
The study provides novel evidence for distinct neural substrates underlying SI in MDD, highlighting the involvement of hippocampal-prefrontal circuits and sensory integration regions. Despite limitations related to cross-sectional design and medication effects, the findings enhance the understanding of suicide-related brain changes and may aid in identifying biological markers of suicide risk.}

abstract = {Introduction
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by widespread alterations in brain network organization, but the relationship between temporal dynamics and network connectivity remains poorly understood. We investigated how intrinsic neural timescales (INT), measured through the autocorrelation window (ACW), relate to functional connectivity (FC) in MDD during a disorder-specific task paradigm.
Methods
21 MDD patients, 19 schizophrenia patients (clinical comparison), and 21 healthy controls underwent fMRI scanning during a self-evaluation task. We analyzed temporal dynamics using ACW and examined FC using Network-Based Statistics. The relationship between ACW and FC was assessed using Bayesian modeling.
Results
MDD patients showed significantly reduced ACW compared to controls, with the strongest reductions in Control (β = −0.264), Default Mode (β = −0.203), and Somatomotor (β = −0.177) networks. Network-Based Statistics revealed increased FC in MDD (243 unique connections) particularly within Default and Control networks. MDD patients exhibited a disorder-specific inverse relationship between ACW and FC (β = −0.119) that was absent in controls and contrasted with the positive relationship observed in schizophrenia patients (β = 0.189).
Discussion
Our findings reveal that MDD involves both temporal dysregulation (shortened neural timescales) and spatial disruption (increased connectivity), with a specific alteration in how these properties are coupled. This suggests that MDD might be understood as involving disrupted integration of temporal and spatial brain dynamics, offering novel perspectives for biomarker development and therapeutic interventions targeting temporal processing abnormalities.}

abstract = {Background
Lack of widespread use of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) in clinical practice inhibits measurement of treatment follow-up for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study developed, validated and applied a machine learning model to estimate PHQ-9 scores for MDD patients using relevant notes from electronic medical records (EMR).
Methods
Information from structured and unstructured sections of prescriber notes from a multi-source real-world mental health database were used to estimate PHQ-9 scores (ePHQ-9). Model performance and agreement were evaluated using binary and categorical PHQ-9 outcomes. The final model strategy was applied to MDD patient encounters without scores to assess the extent of added available PHQ-9 measures.
Results
A final model was developed from 48,594 patients and 143,224 clinical encounters with a recorded PHQ-9 score, and then applied to 196,819 MDD patients. Overall model performance was high with an AUC 0.81, PPV 0.71 and NPV 0.76. The addition of ePHQ-9 scores increased the average number of available scores per patient per year by 2.8×.
Limitations
The model was developed using prescribing mental health providers' clinical notes, which limits generalizability to other contexts (e.g., primary care). The PHQ-9 is designed to be patient-reported, whereas this model strategy estimates PHQ-9 scores using clinicians' notes, which results in some expected discrepancies.
Conclusions
This validated ePHQ-9 model contributes to addressing measurement gaps in depression treatment and research by adding substantially to the number of measures available in real-world data for clinical follow-up.}

abstract = {Multiscale dynamical systems, modeled by high-dimensional stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with wide-ranging characteristic timescales, arise across diverse fields of science and engineering, but their numerical solvers often encounter severe efficiency bottlenecks. This paper introduces a novel DeePODE method, which consists of an Evolutionary Monte Carlo Sampling method (EMCS) and an efficient end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) to predict multiscale dynamical systems. The method's primary contribution is its approach to the “curse of dimensionality”– the exponential increase in data requirements as dimensions increase. By integrating Monte Carlo sampling with the system's inherent evolutionary dynamics, DeePODE efficiently generates high-dimensional time-series data covering trajectories with wide characteristic timescales or frequency spectra in the phase space. Appropriate coverage on the frequency spectrum of the training data proves critical for data-driven time-series prediction ability, as neural networks exhibit an intrinsic learning pattern of progressively capturing features from low to high frequencies. We validate this finding across dynamical systems from ecological systems to reactive flows, including a predator-prey model, a power system oscillation, a battery electrolyte thermal runaway, and turbulent reaction-diffusion systems with complex chemical kinetics. The method demonstrates robust generalization capabilities, allowing pre-trained DNN models to accurately predict the behavior in previously unseen scenarios, largely due to the delicately constructed dataset. While theoretical guarantees remain to be established, empirical evidence shows that DeePODE achieves the accuracy of implicit numerical schemes while maintaining the computational efficiency of explicit schemes. This work underscores the crucial relationship between training data distribution and neural network generalization performance. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning approaches in modeling complex dynamical systems across scientific and engineering domains.}

X-AI integrates advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) capabilities into a workflow-driven environment that enables energy engineers to construct and deploy predictive models without prior AI expertise. A key innovation is the introduction of Dragon Dawn (D2), an intelligent agent powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based reasoning. D2 interprets natural language instructions, retrieves domain-relevant knowledge, orchestrates modeling workflows, and guides multi-step optimization processes, thereby lowering technical barriers and cognitive load for users. To quantitatively evaluate platform usability, a novel metric termed Cognitive-Operation Efficiency Ratio (COER) is proposed, capturing both task efficiency and cognitive effort. Experimental evaluation shows that D2 significantly enhances modeling productivity, with over eightfold improvement in COER. A real-world case study on inflow forecasting in cascade hydropower systems validates the platform’s capabilities. By comparing LSTM and D2-assisted XGBoost models, the study demonstrates how the agent facilitates iterative reasoning, feature enhancement, and hyperparameter tuning.

The demand for cooling capacity to maintain animal thermal comfort escalates during the summer, and year after year, global warming creates increasingly challenging conditions for temperature control. Drying forage constitutes a second significant energy-intensive process, requiring a large amount of thermal power. This work focuses on evaluating the economic and energetic benefits of integrating the forage drying process with a low-temperature waste heat recovery system in a dairy farm. In this context, the optimal solution lies in exploiting the waste heat generated by the enclosed barn chiller as an energy source to aid forage drying, thereby maximizing energy efficiency. The system outlined here uses a hydronic system to extract excess heat from the barn and convey it to the drying process, reducing overall expenses. The results of this comprehensive technical and economic feasibility study demonstrate the viability of implementing such a heat recovery system in the facility. Notably, recovering thermal power from the barn chiller allows for saving about 30 % of the fuel dedicated to the dryer burner (between 3.5 and 5.5 kWh per day per cow depending on the ambient conditions), guaranteeing a short payback period. Moreover, the carbon footprint of the farm can be drastically reduced, cutting more than 250 kg of CO2-equivalent emissions per cow each year.}

This study focuses on the effects of fine-tuning on each of the four AI models—Gemini 1.5, Gemini 1.0, BERT, and XLNet—and their performance on chemistry tasks. The models were implemented using three evaluation methods: Seq2Seq for Sodium Reaction Grading, a Regression Task for Overall Grading, and Attention-Based Grading for Key Steps Grading. The fine-tuning process significantly improved the models' accuracy, precision, and stability. Gemini 1.5 outperformed the other models across all three metrics, with accuracy increasing from 80 % to 89.5 % and TPR from 0.73 to 0.93, whereas Gemini 1.0 achieved TPR gains from 0.69 to 0.89.

These advances highlight the critical role of fine-tuning in refining AI model output to align with expert grading standards, ensuring accuracy and reliability in assessment. The results confirm that fine-tuning is essential in preparing AI models for teaching applications, particularly for complex tasks such as chemistry evaluation, thus enabling scalable solutions.

Recent advancements in deep learning have led to notable improvements in MDE through end-to-end manner. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on MDE using clean input data, neglecting the challenges posed by Out-of-Distribution (OoD) corrupted data in the real-world scenarios. This oversight limits the generalization and robustness of advanced MDE models, resulting in unpredictable errors. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose an OoD MDE model that employs local invariant regression. Specifically, we introduce a novel HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) consistency loss function, which utilizes local invariant feature regression to capture robust local geometric structures and enhance robustness to the common corruptions in a self-supervised manner. Additionally, we present a novel Cascaded Iterative Enhancement network (CIE-Depth), designed to accurately and robustly predict monocular depth maps through adaptive hierarchical interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves highly competitive performance against state-of-the-art techniques on the KITTI, NYUv2, SUN RGBD and underwater FLSea datasets. Further evaluations highlight the robustness of our approach when applied to the corrupted KITTI-C and NYUv2-C datasets.}

abstract = {Background
Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts >300 million individuals worldwide, highlighting a significant public health issue. However, the uneven distribution of medical resources and the complexity of diagnostic methods have resulted in inadequate attention to this disorder in numerous countries and regions.
Methods
This paper introduces a high-performance MDD diagnosis tool named MDD-LLM, an AI-driven framework that utilizes fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) and extensive real-world samples to tackle challenges in MDD diagnosis. Specifically, we select 274,348 individual records from the UK Biobank cohort and design three tabular data transformation methods to create a large corpus for training and evaluating the proposed method. To illustrate the advantages of MDD-LLM, we perform comprehensive experiments and provide several comparative analyses against existing model-based solutions across multiple evaluation metrics.
Results
Experimental results show that MDD-LLM (70B) achieves an accuracy of 0.8378 and an AUC of 0.8919 (95 % CI: 0.8799–0.9040), significantly outperforming existing machine and deep learning frameworks for MDD diagnosis. Given the limited exploration of LLMs in MDD diagnosis, we examine numerous factors that may influence the performance of our proposed method, including tabular data transformation techniques and different fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, we also analyze the model's interpretability, requiring the MDD-LLM to explain its predictions and provide corresponding reasons.
Conclusion
This paper investigates the application of LLMs and large-scale training samples for diagnosing MDD. The findings indicate that LLMs-driven schemes offer significant potential for accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in MDD diagnosis compared to traditional model-based solutions.}

We explored combinations of options in four sub-processes of the analysis pipelines: six types of brain parcellation, four types of functional connectivity (FC) estimations, three types of site-difference harmonization, and five types of machine-learning methods. A total of 360 different MDD classification biomarkers were constructed using the SRPBS dataset acquired with unified protocols (713 participants from four sites) as the discovery dataset, and datasets from other projects acquired with heterogeneous protocols (449 participants from four sites) were used for independent validation. We repeated the procedure after swapping the roles of the two datasets to identify superior pipelines, regardless of the discovery dataset. The classification results of the top 10 biomarkers showed high similarity, and weight similarity was observed between eight of the biomarkers, except for two that used both data-driven parcellation and FC computation. We applied the top 10 pipelines to the datasets of other psychiatric disorders (autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia), and eight of the biomarkers exhibited sufficient classification performance for both disorders. Our results will be useful for establishing a standardized pipeline for classification biomarkers.}

Cognitive Reserve (CR) has been proposed as a protective factor against cognitive decline and functional impairment in psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder (BD). However, how CR differs between BD, other psychiatric populations, and healthy individuals remains unclear.
Objective
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate differences in CR between individuals with BD, healthy controls (HCs), at-risk populations, and patients with other psychiatric disorders.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for studies assessing CR in BD and control populations, using validated CR measures or proxies (e.g., education, intelligence quotient, occupational status, leisure activities). A multilevel random-effects meta-analysis was performed to compare CR levels between BD and HCs, and BD and other psychiatric disorders.
Results
Twelve studies (N = 1861 participants) met inclusion criteria. Meta-analytic findings revealed that individuals with BD exhibited significantly lower CR than HCs (SMD = -0.45, 95 % CI: -0.69 to -0.20, I² = 84.5 %), whereas no significant differences emerged between BD and MDD (SMD = -0.23, 95 % CI: -0.49 to 0.03, I² = 41.7 %). Sociodemographic and clinical variables did not significantly moderate CR levels.
Conclusion
CR is lower in BD compared to HCs, suggesting its contribution to cognitive and functional impairments. Conversely, similar CR between BD and MDD highlight shared clinical vulnerabilities. These results underscore the need for targeted interventions to enhance CR in patients with BD. Future research should prioritize standardized CR assessment and investigate modifiable factors contributing to CR development in psychiatric populations.}

abstract = {Depression is a complex mental health disorder that presents significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment. This study proposes an innovative approach, leveraging artificial intelligence advancements, to enhance multimodal depression diagnosis. The diagnosis of depression often relies on subjective assessments and clinical interviews, leading to potential biases and inaccuracies. Additionally, integrating diverse data modalities, such as textual, imaging, and audio information, poses technical challenges due to data heterogeneity and high dimensionality. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the RLKT-MDD (Representation Learning and Knowledge Transfer for Multimodal Depression Diagnosis) model framework. Representation learning enables the model to autonomously discover meaningful patterns and features from diverse data sources, surpassing traditional feature engineering methods. Knowledge transfer facilitates the effective transfer of knowledge from related domains, improving the model's performance in depression diagnosis. Furthermore, we analyzed the interpretability of the representation learning process, enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of the diagnostic process. We extensively experimented with the DAIC-WOZ dataset, a diverse collection of multimodal data from clinical settings, to evaluate our proposed approach. The results demonstrate promising outcomes, indicating significant improvements over conventional diagnostic methods. Our study provides valuable insights into cutting-edge techniques for depression diagnosis, enabling more effective and personalized mental health interventions.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents is a prevalent psychiatric condition worldwide with severe consequences. Growing evidence shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate many processes hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of MDD including inflammation, suggesting their suitability as biomarkers. Still, more research is needed regarding miRNAs as biomarkers and the role of inflammation in adolescents with MDD. This study applied the NanoString nCounter technology to identify dysregulated miRNAs in plasma from hospitalized female adolescents with MDD compared to healthy controls, as well as before and after antidepressant treatment. A multiplexed immunoassay was also performed to assess the plasma levels of 27 inflammatory proteins. A total of 33 patients and 14 healthy controls were included in the study. miR-1246 and miR-1253 were downregulated in female adolescents with MDD compared to healthy controls, suggesting their potential as diagnostic biomarkers. Additionally, miR-496 was downregulated with treatment, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Moreover, increased levels of PDGF-BB and IL-7 were seen in adolescents with MDD compared to healthy controls, while IL-9 and MIP-1β levels decreased with antidepressant treatment. Finally, the expression of specific miRNAs were found to correlate with the levels of several inflammatory proteins. In summary, miR-1246, miR-1253, and miR-496 are suggested as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Furthermore, this study contributes in more detail to our understanding of miRNAs, inflammation, and MDD in female adolescents.}

Specifically, we categorize the formal control synthesis problem based on diverse system models, encompassing deterministic, non-deterministic, and stochastic, and various formal safety-critical specifications involving logic, real-time, and real-valued domains. The review covers fundamental formal control synthesis techniques, including abstraction-based approaches and abstraction-free methods. We explore the integration of data-driven synthesis approaches in formal control synthesis. Furthermore, we review formal techniques tailored for multi-agent systems (MAS), with a specific focus on various approaches to address the scalability challenges in large-scale systems.

This paper systematically reviews modelling approaches for these technologies within 84 local energy system optimisation studies. Our findings show that most studies simplify heat pump operation using a constant coefficient of performance (COP), perfect modulation, or a fixed heating capacity. While existing methods account for temperature-dependent COPs, only a few studies include more advanced approaches considering additional impacts. Two main approaches for modelling BER measures are identified: pre-defined retrofit sets with exogenous heat demand or an integrated retrofit selection with endogenous heat demand. While the pre-defined approach offers lower computational effort, it limits the BER solution space. The integrated approach achieves the opposite: a wider solution space but higher complexity. Moreover, only two studies consider the impact of BER measures on the heat supply temperature, an essential link between retrofit measures and heat pump efficiency. Based on our qualitative review, we derive recommendations for energy system modellers. For modelling heat pumps, we recommend using a temperature-dependent COP and heating capacity, as well as a lower modulation limit. Regarding BER measures, the integrated approach should be used for smaller scales (single buildings) while the pre-defined sets are suitable for larger scales. Finally, we propose a research agenda to address limitations and gaps in the current modelling approaches, such as addressing the performance gap between existing COP estimations and heat pump field performance and including a more detailed method for the heat supply temperature.}

abstract = {Background
Gastrodiae Rhizoma (GR) and its extract have been widely used in the treatment of depression, but the underlying mechanism of its antidepressant effects is unclear due to its numerous components.
Purpose
Revealing the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of GR through a comprehensive pharmacology-based in vivo and in vitro investigation.
Methods
A mouse model of depression was established using chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure, and the antidepressant effects of GR were evaluated using systematic behavior. Metabolites in GR decoction and in mouse brain were identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS technology. Core components and targets of GR against MDD were screened based on network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking. The mechanism through which GR mitigated MDD was explored using transcriptome analysis, immunohistochemistry and western blotting in vitro and in vivo.
Results
A total of 273 components were identified in the GR decoction, out of which 15 were detected in the brain of depressed mice treated with the GR decoction. We further identified nine key active ingredients, six essential targets, and fifth signaling pathways associated with the therapeutic effects of GR against MDD. We confirmed that the active ingredients of GR can target the neural stem/precursor cells (NSPCs) in the hippocampus of depressed mice to promote neurogenesis, as evidenced by a significant increase in the numbers of DCX+ cells, BrdU+ cells, BrdU+-DCX+ cells, and BrdU+-NeuN+ cells within the hippocampus of GR-treated mice compared to salinetreated mice under CMS exposure. Moreover, we have identified that the key active constituents of GR, namely gastrodin and parishin C, exert a targeted effect on EGFR to activate PI3K-Akt signaling in NSPCs, thereby facilitating proliferation and differentiation of NSPCs.
Conclusion
The antidepressant effect of GR involves the facilitation of PI3K/Akt-mediated neurogenesis through gastrodin and parishin C targeting EGFR in NSPCs.}

Moreover, current frameworks are efficient only when designing simple chatbot applications while they still require advanced technical knowledge to define complex interactions and are difficult to evolve along with the company needs. In addition, the deployment of a chatbot application usually requires a deep understanding of the targeted platforms, especially back-end connections, increasing the development and maintenance costs. In this paper, we discuss our experiences building, evolving and distributing the Xatkit framework. Xatkit is a model-based framework built around a Domain-Specific Language to define chatbots (and voicebots and bots in general) in a platform-independent way. Xatkit also comes with a runtime engine that automatically deploys the chatbot application and manages the defined conversation logic over the platforms of choice. Xatkit has significantly evolved since its initial release. This paper focuses on describing the evolution and the reasons (technical and non-technical) that triggered them. We believe our lessons learned can be useful to any other initiative trying to build a successful industrial-level chatbot platform, and in general, any type of model-based solution.}

ML design and training are becoming a continuous workflow of various tasks that have dynamic resource demands. Serverless computing is an emerging cloud paradigm that provides transparent resource management and scaling for users and has the potential to revolutionize the routine of ML design and training. However, hosting modern ML workflows on existing serverless platforms has non-trivial challenges due to their intrinsic design limitations such as stateless nature, limited communication support across function instances, and limited function execution duration. These limitations result in a lack of an overarching view and adaptation mechanism for training dynamics, and an amplification of existing problems in ML workflows. To address the above challenges, we propose SMLT, an automated, scalable and adaptive serverless framework on public cloud to enable efficient and user-centric ML design and training. SMLT employs an automated and adaptive scheduling mechanism to dynamically optimize the deployment and resource scaling for ML tasks during training. SMLT further enables user-centric ML workflow execution by supporting user-specified training deadline and budget limit. In addition, by providing an end-to-end design, SMLT solves the intrinsic problems in public cloud serverless platforms such as the communication overhead, limited function execution duration, need for repeated initialization, and also provides explicit fault tolerance for ML training. SMLT is open-sourced and compatible with all major ML frameworks. Our experimental evaluation with large, sophisticated modern ML models demonstrates that SMLT outperforms the state-of-the-art VM-based systems and existing public cloud serverless ML training frameworks in both training speed (up to 8×) and monetary cost (up to 3×).}

Results revealed that suicide attempters exhibited significantly greater microbial richness and distinct beta-diversity patterns. Notably, they had higher levels of Fenollaria timonensis and lower levels of Corynebacterium aurimucosum. Additionally, 25 metabolic pathways differed between groups, with several linked to energy metabolism and amino acid processing—processes previously associated with MDD and suicidal behavior. These findings suggest that microbiome composition may influence suicide risk through gut-brain axis-mediated pathways, although due to the exploratory nature of this study further investigation is needed to validate our findings. Given the microbiome's modifiability, future research should explore microbial-targeted interventions as a potential strategy for suicide prevention in individuals with MDD.}

Achieving carbon neutrality requires defossilizing both the energy system and industry, which are closely linked through shared resources and energy carrier exchange. However, many studies treat them separately, overlooking important feedbacks. This study uses a techno-economic model for German industry to compare coupled and sequential (soft-linked) optimization with the energy system model PyPSA-Eur. Coupled optimization yields similar overall costs (0.3% lower) but different resource use: industry relies more on direct electrification, uses less biomass and hydrogen, and achieves negative emissions (− 24 Mt CO2), offsetting energy system emissions. In contrast, the soft-linked approach treats sectoral neutrality independently, requiring more costly direct air capture. This study underscores the role of cross-sectoral feedback in resource and emission allocation and hydrogen use and reveals limitations of sequential approaches in representing these feedbacks.}

The ASAM framework utilizes the CESAM architecture and System Modelling Language (SysML) to create multi-architecture models of the AM process, integrating operational, functional, and constructional perspectives. These models formalize the system architecture, providing a foundation for developing automated design validation, flaw detection, and optimization mechanisms. Future iterations of ASAM will incorporate advanced algorithms for real-time parameter optimization and predictive analytics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the initial phase focuses on conceptual modelling and scalability assessment. Illustrative scenarios across aerospace, healthcare, and education industries are used to evaluate the adaptability and potential impact of the framework. The results highlight ASAM's capability to formalize AM workflow architectures and lay the groundwork for improved efficiency, compliance, and scalability in future implementations.}

We propose an LLM-agent-based framework in which LLM agents act as behaviorally rich proxies for human travelers. By leveraging LLMs’ capabilities in natural language understanding, contextual reasoning, and generalization, our framework aims to overcome key limitations of traditional ABMs and unlock new modeling possibilities. We design LLM agents with structured profiles, memory systems, perception, decision-making, and action modules to align with the principles of activity-based travel demand modeling. Through system design and literature synthesis, we outline the conceptual and practical advantages of this approach and support our vision with a small-scale proof of concept simulation. Lastly, we discuss the remaining challenges and propose hybrid modeling as a near-term integration strategy. By positioning LLM agents as a novel and promising paradigm, we aim to expand the role of LLMs in agent-based transportation modeling and pave the way for new approaches to travel demand modeling.}

Current methods typically integrate multimodal information within samples to distinguish positive from negative samples, but they often neglect the relationships between samples. Despite similarities within the same class, individual variations exist. By leveraging these relationships, we can provide supervision signals for both inter- and intra-class samples, thereby enhancing the discriminative power of user representations. Inspired by this observation, we introduce IISFD, a novel approach that concurrently exploits intra-sample contrastive learning and inter-sample contrastive learning with hard negative sampling. This method comprehensively considers information both within individual samples and across samples. Specifically, we decompose the multimodal inputs of each sample, including audio, vision and text, into modality-common features and modality-specific features. To obtain better decomposed feature representations, we integrate intra-sample contrastive learning and inter-sample contrastive learning with hard negative sampling. Additionally, detailed modal information is obtained through unimodal reconstruction. By passing the decomposed features through a carefully designed multimodal fusion module, we obtain more discriminative user representations. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model, highlighting its effectiveness in leveraging both intra- and inter-sample information for enhanced MDD.}

abstract = {Anticipating the future of the oceans is an emerging challenge in the Anthropocene. The complexity, dynamic nature, and limited accessibility of the marine environment make many ecological processes harder to understand and quantify than in terrestrial ecosystems. Many of these processes depend on marine functional connectivity (MFC) across different spatial and temporal scales. MFC is defined as the movement of marine organisms transferring genes, matter or energy between habitat patches or ecosystems, thereby impacting their biodiversity, functioning, and resilience. Advances in MFC understanding and quantification are essential for the effective management and protection of marine ecosystems and their services. This Viewpoint article aims to help bridge the gap between empiricists in this field and theoretical ecology modellers. We discuss conceptual and mathematical limitations as well as data shortages for the development of meta-population, meta-community, and meta-ecosystem models. The primary challenges in applying meta-ecology theory to MFC data include accurately identifying the respective value of environmental patches for connectivity and predicting environmental variability across those patches. Limitations in empirical data mainly encompass (a) environmental variation and seascape patchiness; (b) diversity in organism life cycle and behaviour; (c) distribution and ecology of non-commercial species; and (d) fluxes of genes and matter at different spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales. We advocate that enhancing the interaction between MFC modellers and empiricists will play a major role in overcoming these limitations and promoting the application of meta-ecology theory and models in ecological connectivity research. This will boost our capacity in providing operational solutions forcurrent threats to marine ecosystems.}

This approach struggles to accommodate runtime variations — such as fluctuations in workload — resulting in a mismatch between pre-deployed models and actual demand, thereby hindering the system’s ability to deliver high-precision services within strict latency constraints. To address this critical challenge, we propose a runtime reconfiguration mechanism that enables post-hoc model adjustments based on real-time resource availability revealed after request arrival. To mitigate the error amplification problem — stemming from predictive inaccuracies that lead to biases in both prior deployment and posterior reconfiguration — we introduce a gradient suppression method. This method trains the prediction network by minimizing end-to-end regret, thereby substantially reducing posterior bias. Experimental results show that our approach significantly reduces accuracy loss — by up to threefold — while maintaining throughput comparable to state-of-the-art baselines.}

However, increasing temporal, spatial, and sectoral resolutions have led to large-scale linear programming (LP) models that are often (over)simplified to remain computationally tractable—frequently at the expense of model fidelity. This paper challenges the common belief that LP formulations cannot be improved without sacrificing their accuracy. Inspired by graph theory, we propose to model energy systems using energy assets (vertices), as a single building-block, and flows to connect between them. This reduces the need for additional components such as nodes and connections. The resulting formulation is more compact, without sacrificing accuracy, and leverages the inherent graph structure of energy systems. To evaluate performance, we implemented and compared four common modelling approaches varying in their use of building blocks and flow representations. We conducted experiments using TulipaEnergyModel.jl and applied them to a multi-sector case study with varying problem sizes. Results show that our single-building-block (1BB-1F) approach reduces variables and constraints by 26% and 35%, respectively, and achieves a 1.27x average speedup in solving time without any loss in model fidelity. The speedup increases with problem size, making this approach particularly advantageous for large-scale models. Our findings demonstrate that not all LPs are equal in quality and that better reformulations can lead to substantial computational benefits. This paper also aims to raise awareness of model quality considerations in energy system optimisation and promote more efficient formulations without compromising fidelity.}

In this context, we hypothesized that individuals with MDE who exhibit higher vulnerability to seasonal changes display distinct chronobiological and sleep regulation disturbances. We investigated how sleep and circadian rhythms, assessed through subjective markers (N = 254) and objective actigraphic (N = 96) and polysomnographic markers (N = 54)—varied in individuals with MDE according to their vulnerability to seasonal changes. To conduct this dimensional approach, that may be closer to the pathophysiology, we assessed the seasonal vulnerability using the Global Seasonality Score (GSS) from the Seasonal Patterns Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ). The results revealed that greater seasonal vulnerability was correlated to increased excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth scale), (r = 0.218, p < 0.001), shorter REM sleep latency (r = -0.381, p = 0.005), (even when controlling for age using the Kupfer index (r = -0.452, p < 0.001)), and shorter N1 sleep latency (r = -0.411, p = 0.002). The regression model retained only the polysomnographic markers—N1 sleep latency, REM sleep latency, Kupfer Index—independently and significantly associated to the GSS. This study confirms a link between seasonal vulnerability and shortened REM sleep latency, emphasizing that light and the photoperiod play a pivotal role in regulating the systems involved in REM sleep dysregulation in depressive disorders.}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) agentic workflow have facilitated complex engineering processes, their application in BEM has not been specifically explored. This paper investigates the feasibility of automating BEM using LLM agentic workflow. We developed a generic LLM-planning-based workflow that takes a building description as input and generates an error-free EnergyPlus building energy model. Our robust workflow includes four core agents: 1) Building Description Pre-Processing, 2) IDF Object Information Extraction, 3) Single IDF Object Generator Suite, and 4) IDF Debugging Agent. These agents divide the complex tasks into manageable sub-steps, enabling LLMs to generate accurate and reliable results at each stage. The case study demonstrates the successful translation of a building description into an error-free EnergyPlus model for the iUnit modular building at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The effectiveness of our workflow surpasses: 1) naive prompt engineering, 2) other LLM-based workflows, and 3) manual modeling, in terms of accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency. The paper concludes with a discussion on the interplay between foundational models and LLM agent planning design, advocating for the use of fine-tuned, specialized models to advance this field.}

We reveal for a German case study, that the integration of DAC with renewable energy sources necessitates temporal and spatial considerations, as fluctuations in energy supply and demand can significantly impact operational feasibility. We demonstrate energy demand fluctuations of DAC exceeding 100 % over the course of a year and estimate future DAC costs in Germany in a range from 197 €/tCO2 to 1035 €/tCO2, depending on the region and technology.

Anhedonia is a hallmark symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), associated with impairments in various aspects of reward. VIVRE is the first study in patients with MDD receiving antidepressant therapy to include longitudinal assessment of reward behavior using the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), a validated behavioral paradigm for the objective assessment of reward and effort-based decision-making in patients with MDD.
Methods
Randomized, double-blind study of vortioxetine (10 or 20 mg/day) versus desvenlafaxine (50 mg/day) in adults with MDD and partial response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy. Motivation for reward based on the proportion of hard trial choices was assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment.
Results
There was no difference in the proportion of hard trial choices between the vortioxetine (n = 288) and desvenlafaxine (n = 300) treatment groups at baseline. Minimal change in parameters of reward motivation was seen over the 8-week treatment period in either group. The between-group difference in the proportion of hard trial choices at week 8 was not statistically significant (odds ratio: 0.97 [95 % CI: 0.82, 1.14]; P = 0.72). Similar results were obtained when controlling for reward probability, reward magnitude, trial number, and sex, or when limiting to the first 50 trials (excluding computer-selected trials).
Limitations
Exploratory analyses evaluating the utility of the EEfRT in clinical populations.
Conclusions
Experience from the VIVRE study suggests that further research is required to fully determine the clinical utility of the EEfRT for assessment of antidepressant treatment effects in patients with MDD.

abstract = {Background
The brain of major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with altered functional connectivity (FC) compared to that of healthy individuals when processing positive and negative visual stimuli. Building upon alterations in brain connectivity, some researchers have employed electroencephalography (EEG) to study FC in MDD, aiming to enhance both diagnosis and treatment; however, the results have been inconsistent and the studies involving FC during emotional recognition are limited. This study aims to 1) investigate the effects of MDD on EEG patterns during visual emotional processing, 2) explore the therapeutic effects of antidepressant treatment on brain FC within the first week, and assess whether these effects can be predictive of treatment outcomes four weeks later, and 3) study baseline FC parameter biomarkers that can be used to predict treatment responsiveness in MDD patients.
Methods
This clinical observational study recruited 38 healthy controls (HC) and 48 MDD patients. Patients underwent an EEG exam while looking at validated images of happy and sad faces at week 0 and 1. MDD patients were categorized into treatment responders and non-responders after 4 weeks of treatment. We conducted the FC analysis (node strength (NS), global efficiency (GE), and cluster coefficient (CC)) on HC and MDD patients using graph theoretical analysis. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the influence of MDD on FC compared to HC, while controlling for confounding variables including age, gender, and academic degrees.
Results
At week 0 and week 1, MDD patients revealed to have significant reductions in FC parameters (NS, GE and CC) compared to HC. When comparing MDD patients at week 1 post-antidepressant treatment and pre-treatment, no significant differences in FC changes were observed. Multivariable regression revealed a significant negative effect on FC of MDD. Compared to the treatment non-responsive group, the responsive group revealed a significantly higher FC in delta band frequency at baseline.
Conclusions
MDD patient group showed impaired FC during visual emotion-processing and we observed baseline FC parameters to be associated with treatment response at week 4. While signs of FC changes were observed in the brain after a week of treatment, it is possible that one week may still be insufficient to demonstrate significant alterations in the brain. Our results suggest the potential utilization of EEG-based FC as an indicative measure for predicting treatment response and monitoring treatment progress in MDD patients.}

With the increasing accumulation of multimodal MRI data in recent years, integrating information from various modalities has become an effective strategy for improving the detection of brain disorders. This study focuses on identifying major depressive disorder (MDD) by using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI in conjunction with structural MRI data. We collected ASL and structural MRI data from 260 participants, including 169 MDD patients and 91 healthy controls. We developed an explainable fusion method to identify MDD, utilizing cerebral blood flow (CBF) data from ASL perfusion MRI and brain tissue volumes from structural MRI. The fusion model, which integrates multimodal data, demonstrated superior predictive performance for MDD. By combining MRI regional volumes with CBF data, we achieved more effective results than using each modality independently. Additionally, we analyzed feature importance and interactions to explain the fusion model. We identified fourteen important features, comprising eight regional volumes and six regional CBF measures, that played a crucial role in the identification of MDD. Furthermore, we found three feature interactions among the important features and seven interactions between structural and functional features, which were particularly prominent in the model. The results of this study suggest that the fusion learning approach, which integrates ASL and structural MRI data, is effective in detecting MDD. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the model explanation method can reveal key features that influence the decisions of models, as well as potential interactions among these key features or between functional and structural features in identifying MDD.}

For the first question, in MDD patients, MED22 GReX was associated with neglect, sexual, and emotional abuse, while EReX was associated with neglect. For the second question, in healthy volunteers, MED22 SNPs were associated with higher neuroticism (Beta=0.2284; p-value=0.008), indicating reduced stress resilience.

abstract = {In recent years, inter-floor noise has become a significant issue in densely populated areas, particularly in high-rise residential buildings. Heavy-weight impact sound constitute a substantial portion of these inter-floor noise problems. However, current studies on inter-floor noise have predominantly focused on alleviating light-weight impact sound. This emphasizes the urgent need for the development of technologies to alleviate heavy-weight impact sound. Furthermore, the stiffness of members in reinforced concrete buildings decreases due to various factors, leading to reduced heavy-weight impact sound alleviation performance. This study proposed a method to alleviate heavy-weight impact sound by restoring structural stiffness using prestressed Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) strips. The effectiveness of the proposed method in alleviating heavy-weight impact sound was evaluated by measuring the Vibration Acceleration Level (VAL) due to impact ball force. In this study, dynamic analysis through the finite element method was conducted on both unit members and a remodeled multi-story housing unit with a bearing-wall system to obtain VAL. Variables for the unit members were member thickness, the strengthening of CFRP strips, and prestressing levels. For the bearing-wall system, the degree of damage before strengthening was considered. The results indicate that prestressed CFRP strips effectively alleviate heavy-weight impact sound by reducing both damage and vibration response. In the unit member analysis, applying a prestressing level of 900 MPa to CFRP strips significantly reduced the extent of damage, VAL, and Single Number Quantity (SNQ). As the prestressing level increased from 900 MPa to 1200 MPa, the extent of damage decreased. However, this increase in prestressing did not result in a significant reduction in VAL and SNQ. The bearing-wall system model with prestressed CFRP strips showed clear reductions in damage, VAL, and SNQ. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of prestressed CFRP strips in restoring damaged members and enhancing the heavy-weight impact sound insulation performance of the members.}

We examine the major factors of total HEU efficiency using input–output and Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System models. The analyses are based on time-series non-competitive input–output tables at constant prices for 1986—2018 compiled by this study, industrial energy satellite accounts, and the data from the Chinese Household Income Project. First, the findings reveal that while total HEU is increasing rapidly, HEU intensity has declined, suggesting that household consumption has become more energy efficient. However, the primary cause is the reduction of energy intensity in production sectors rather than the household consumption structure. Second, HEU will continue to rise with advancing urbanization and expected income increasing in the future. Furthermore, changing consumption patterns may increase urban and rural HEU, with an increasing share of household facilities, transportation, and communication further driving energy use in upstream industries. Therefore, the key to improving HEU efficiency is more strongly related to technological advances on the production side than changing consumption patterns. Energy policy should primarily focus on promoting industrial technological advances and measures to advance circular economy development.}

However, achieving cooperative control in multi-agent systems is challenging due to issues such as non-stationarity and partial observability. Recent advancements in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provide new perspectives to address these challenges. Therefore, we propose using the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm with communication to address multiple ships’ cooperation problems under partial observability. We developed two tasks based on OpenAI’s gym environment: cooperative navigation and cooperative collision avoidance. In these tasks, ships must not only learn effective control strategies but also establish communication protocols with other agents. We analyze the impact of external noise on communication, the effect of inter-agent communication on performance, and the communication patterns learned by the agents. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively addresses cooperative navigation and collision avoidance among multiple vessels, significantly outperforming traditional single-agent algorithms. Agents establish a consistent communication protocol, enabling them to compensate for missing information through shared observations and achieve better coordination.}

In this paper, both steady-state vibration tests using a semi-large scale vibrating system and post-impulse free vibration tests are reported. Geotextile bags were filled with 5 different proportions of rubber particles (0%–10% by mass) mixed with sand. A geophone measured the velocity response of the system. Accelerometers were placed above and below the bags. To diagnose the influence of the bags on the dynamic response of the system, Resonant Amplitude, Resonant Frequency, Equivalent Dynamic Stiffness, Equivalent Damping Ratio, Equivalent Dynamic Shear Modulus and Equivalent Dynamic Shear Strain were measured and computed above the bags. The results show that increasing the rubber content leads to a decline of both stiffness and frequency. Damping decreased so that the vibration amplitude increased at low rubber contents (from 0% to 7.5%), but the trend reversed at 10% rubber content such that the damping was greater, and the amplitude less, even than the no-rubber case. Additionally, results showed that vertical displacement beneath the bag was increasingly reduced relative to the above-bag value as rubber content increased.}

However, according to many studies, hydrogen generation will shift to greenhouse gas (GHG)-neutral sources and supply, substantially increasing demands to meet ambitious climate protection targets in the European Union. Therefore, the model-based analysis in this paper addresses where hydrogen will come from in a GHG-neutral target system. A scenario study examines different expansion paths of renewable energy generation technologies and variations in European cooperation regarding energy trading. The model results show that a domestic European hydrogen supply strategy is cost-efficient. This result is robust even with higher self-sufficiency shares of individual countries. However, delayed or restricted expansions of renewable electricity generation technologies lead to increased hydrogen demands for power generation and increased pipeline-bound hydrogen imports in winter from the Middle East and North Africa in the model results. Furthermore, scenarios with higher photovoltaic shares exhibit increased demand for hydrogen storage for seasonal energy supply and demand balancing and increased hydrogen demands for power generation. A cost-efficient hydrogen supply strategy should, therefore, particularly focus on the expansion of onshore wind energy and hydrogen supply technologies in Europe and strengthen European cooperation for energy supply infrastructures.}

abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating illness that affects millions of people worldwide. Currently available antidepressants often take weeks to months to reach their full effect, which leads to an increased risk of suicidal behavior in patients with MMD. Intranasally, esketamine has emerged as an alternative to current antidepressants because of its rapid onset and long-lasting effects in patients with MDD. Animal models are useful for the initial pharmacological screening and for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of new drugs with potential against MDD. There is a lack of data on alternative routes of drug administration, either oral or injectable, that can be used in preclinical studies. This study aimed to test whether ketamine has antidepressant-like effects in mice when administered via nebulization using a low-cost apparatus. When mice whose depressive-like behavior was induced by corticosterone were treated with nebulized ketamine at concentrations of 1.3, 2.6, and 5.2 mg/mL, immobility was reduced by 38.6 %, 62.0 %, and 61.1 %, respectively, in the forced swimming test (FST) and 43.6 %, 42.1 %, and 57.9 %, respectively, in the tail suspension test (TST).

When depression-like behavior was induced by the association between dexamethasone and unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) exposure, immobility was reduced by 26.1 %, 55.3 %, and 19.1 % in FST. Mice treated with nebulized ketamine did not show significant changes in the distance covered or in the time spent moving in the open field test. The efficacy of intraperitoneal and nebulized ketamine is equivalent, which shows that nebulization can be an alternative inexpensive route of drug administration for behavioral studies in rodents.}

abstract = {Background
There is ample evidence that socioeconomic status, objectively quantified by tangible resources, impacts mental health outcomes. However, the psychosocial mechanism linking objective socioeconomic status (OSS) with mental health is not clear. This study examined to what extent associations between OSS and the twelve-month prevalence of mental disorders, are mediated by the individual perception of social conditions—the subjective social status (SSS).
Methods
We employed data from the Iranian Mental Health Survey (IranMHS), collected through interviews with 7886 Iranian adults. We used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1) to assess any mental disorder, any anxiety disorder, and any major depressive disorder (MDD). We measured OSS based on education, occupation, wealth, and a composite OSS index, while SSS was evaluated using the MacArthur scale. We investigated the indirect associations and stratified the analyses by gender.
Results
In this national sample, 4499 (57.0 %) were women, 4380 (55.5 %) were urban, and the mean (SE) age was 31.7 (0.2) years. SSS had a partial to full mediating effect. Specifically, there were significant indirect effects for the impact of wealth (mediation percentage: 78.9 %), education (73.3 %), OSS index (56.0 %), and occupation (33.3 %) on any mental disorder through SSS.
Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the data presents constraints in establishing causal relationships.
Conclusions
Our findings highlight the role of SSS as the psychosocial mechanism linking OSS with mental disorders. A better understanding of the social factors that influence the association between OSS and SSS may enhance our insight into the mental health effects of socioeconomic status.}

This acute psychiatric condition is characterized by feelings of worthlessness, insomnia, extreme anxiety, or maternal neglect. Intranasal oxytocin (OT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have the potential to address impaired social cognition; nonetheless, their neuronal underpinnings, along with their safety and efficacy, are little comprehended. This study examines the effects of rTMS stimulation with an oxytocin agonist or antagonist in a PPD model. We employed the maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW) strategy for 21 days to attain our objective. Oxytocin acetate (agonist) and atosiban (antagonist) were administered by injection twice daily for three consecutive days following the model according to the established protocol. A single session of rTMS involved the application of high-frequency stimulation (20 Hz) one hour following the final injection. Behavioral testing and brain collection were conducted 12 h post-rTMS. The results indicated that treatment with OT followed by rTMS stimulation decreased neuronal cell death and microglial activation, meanwhile enhancing synaptic plasticity through the upregulation of PSD95, Synapsin I, and Synaptophysin. Simultaneously, both OT therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation demonstrated a significant capacity to alter autophagy activity and astrocyte function. Nonetheless, OTA therapy followed by rTMS did not exhibit the same pattern of outcomes. Our findings indicate that the combination of rTMS stimulation and an oxytocin agonist in a PPD model may mitigate depression-like behavior.}

abstract = {Background
Differentiating between patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is clinically challenging. This study aimed to explore the potential of radiomic textural features for discriminating BD and MDD.
Methods
A total 253 subjects (114 patients with BD, 139 patients with MDD) with T1-weighted MRI data were recruited. Radiomics features and gray matter volume (GMV) features were extracted from each brain region. A novel high-level MSN_II feature method based on radiomic features was proposed. And a total of 21 MSN features (5 MSN_I and 16 MSN_II) based on different combinations of the 5 types of radiomic textural feature were calculated. Classification models were constructed using various combinations of MSNs or GMV, and their performance and stability was evaluated through 2000 repeated experiments.
Results
The model built with combined features (GMV and GMV + MSN_II_GLCM_GLSZM_NGTDM) showed the best classification performance (AUC = 0.896±0.058, ACC = 0.831±0.064) in the validation cohort. After MANOVA analysis and FDR correlation, the MSN_II_GLCM_GLSZM_NGTDM values in 4 regions (right rectus gyrus, right temporal pole: middle temporal gyrus, Vermis3 and Vermis10) showed significant difference between BD and MDD.
Limitation
The main limitation of this study is that the data is derived from a single center without an external independent test set.
Conclusions
Incorporating the high-level MSN_II based on radiomics features can improve the classification performance compared to models solely relying on GMV features alone. This result implied the potential application of the proposed high level MSN method and radiomics textural features on the MDD and BD clinical studies.}

However, identifying the specific functional process associated with RSFC alterations is challenging, and it remains unclear whether alterations in RSFC for depressed individuals are directly related to the RNT process or to individual characteristics distinct from the negative thinking process per se. To investigate the relationship between RSFC alterations and the RNT process in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), we compared RSFC with functional connectivity during an induced negative-thinking state (NTFC) in terms of their predictability of RNT traits and associated whole-brain connectivity patterns using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) and connectome-wide association (CWA) analyses. Thirty-six MDD participants and twenty-six healthy control participants underwent both resting state and induced negative thinking state fMRI scans. Both RSFC and NTFC distinguished between healthy and depressed individuals with CPM. However, trait RNT in depressed individuals, as measured by the Ruminative Responses Scale-Brooding subscale, was only predictable from NTFC, not from RSFC. CWA analysis revealed that negative thinking in depression was associated with higher functional connectivity between the default mode and executive control regions, which was not observed in RSFC. These findings suggest that RNT in depression involves an active mental process encompassing multiple brain regions across functional networks, which is not represented in the resting state. Although RSFC indicates brain functional alterations in MDD, they may not directly reflect the negative thinking process.}

This study evaluates various data imputation methods for minutely-resolved global horizontal irradiance, direct normal irradiance, and wind speed time series, with missingness ranging from two to ninety percent. Alongside standard statistical tests, a novel validation criterion is introduced by directly evaluating the impact of imputation methods on energy system modeling. While certain imputation methods demonstrate strong point-wise statistical accuracy, they do not necessarily preserve the underlying data distribution. The performance of these methods is strongly influenced by the type of time series and the missingness mechanism, either continuous gaps or randomly missing data points. In energy system optimization, multiple imputation by chained equations, k-nearest neighbors, linear interpolation, and simple moving average yield the best results, outperforming more sophisticated deep learning-based methods. Overall, k-nearest neighbors consistently outperformed the other approaches across all validation criteria. By comprehensively evaluating the statistical performance of imputation methods and their impact on energy system modeling, this study offers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners addressing missing data in energy system applications.}

To investigate the interactions among the multi-body system’s components and ascertain the collective motion dynamics during operational states, initial steps involved developing mathematical models for each individual component. Subsequently, a holistic model for the entire DFMVMS was formulated by integrating these component models via coupling boundary conditions, with the model’s accuracy subsequently affirmed. Analytical scenarios, including three foundational motion states of the FMV, were structured to explore the influence of FMV dynamics on the DFMVMS’s overall behaviour. Moreover, specific operational scenarios were tailored to reflect two principal functions of the DFMVMS—production and transfer.

While existing studies primarily focus on renewable energy integration, energy efficiency measures, and Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions, comprehensive analyses addressing the interplay between energy demand and supply remain scarce. This study adopts a holistic approach to decarbonization, incorporating both demand-side and supply-side measures to maximize energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in pharmaceutical production processes. Through expert interviews, data analysis, and thermal energy system modeling of four pharmaceutical production sites, key decarbonization measures were identified and evaluated using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization framework. The results demonstrate that decarbonization rates exceeding 50%, and even 100% in some cases, can be achieved without increasing total annual costs. The transition to electricity-based energy systems, particularly those utilizing heat pumps and heat recovery technologies, was identified as an energy-efficient pathway, significantly lowering primary energy consumption. Where available, integration of biomass and biogas or biomethane showed to yield cost benefits compared to full electrification while also reducing system complexity. This study advances the understanding of decarbonization in the pharmaceutical sector by presenting a cost-effective and scalable roadmap that balances technical feasibility, regulatory constraints, and sustainability goals. The findings underscore the importance of integrating tailored demand-side improvements, such as HVAC optimization, with advanced supply-side technologies to achieve substantial emission reductions while maintaining operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.}

A feeding strategy applied to a group of pigs results in unequal animal responses and environmental impacts due to inter-individual variability in lean growth potential and nutritional requirements. The present work aimed at fairly evaluating pigs’ responses in a given production system. We designed a methodological approach able to (i) virtually assess technical, economic and environmental performances of each fattened pig within a population; and (ii) help determine the pig characteristics resulting in contrasted environmental performances in a conventional system including feedstuffs classically used on French commercial farms. For that purpose, experimental data collected on 732 entire Large White males were used to adjust growth profiles using InraPorc® software and to estimate the amino acid (AA) requirements of pigs. Each individual profile was used to generate a virtual population of 1 000 pigs. For each population, technical performances were simulated with an individual-based model, economic and environmental evaluations were applied to these performances and then averaged to assess the individual performance of each of the 732 original pigs. Climate change, use of fossil resources, acidification, eutrophication potentials and land use impacts were evaluated per kg live BW at farm gate through life cycle assessment. A principal component analysis was applied to the correlation matrix between environmental and economic performances to identify their main drivers. Hierarchical clustering was used to group pigs with similar responses. Three clusters of pigs were distinguished. Cluster 1, with the best environmental and economic performances, combined low feed conversion ratios, relatively low-impact feeds and high protein deposition potential (PDm). Clusters 2 and 3 displayed the worst environmental performances. Cluster 3 had similar feed efficiency and economic performances as Cluster 1, but higher initial AA requirements, resulting in high-impact feeds and a lower protein deposition. Cluster 2 had the lowest-impact feeds due to the lowest initial AA requirements and were the least efficient. Feed efficiency, PDm and AA requirements of pigs at the beginning of fattening were the main factors affecting environmental performances. Contrary to previous studies where group feeding was modelled, we show that feed efficiency alone cannot be retained to identify pigs with the lowest impacts. Other pig characteristics such as AA requirements, PDm and environmental impacts should be accounted for to lower the environmental impacts of pig production.}

While previous research has focused on optimization of district heating expansion at district level, the effect of spatial resolution on the large-scale modelling of transport network expansion remains largely unexplored. This work addresses this gap by analysing how different levels of data aggregation, and thus spatial resolutions, influence key system parameters, including network topology, total system costs and computational efficiency. Results show that increasing spatial resolution leads to a more detailed representation of the network, with the benchmark resolution producing a hybrid transport-distribution network that is approximately six times longer than aggregated cases. Despite this, total heat generation mix and system costs remain comparable across resolutions due to the significantly shorter average branch lengths in the disaggregated case. The present work also quantifies the relation between model accuracy and computational feasibility. While finer resolutions provide more granular insights, they also introduce significant computational costs: for the disaggregated resolution, the model runtime increases to approximately 7400 min (5 days), with the optimization phase being the primary bottleneck, whereas aggregated resolutions remain below 60 min. Moreover, the study highlights a structural limitation in the cost formulation of hot-SPOT, a linear optimization model that is focused on large-scale energy transport modelling, which underestimates network costs by not differentiating between transport and distribution infrastructure, the latter typically characterized by higher specific costs. These findings emphasize the need for strategic aggregation methodologies to balance computational efficiency with network accuracy.}

Three HUPS measures were analyzed: hassle frequency (HF), uplift frequency (UF), and the mean hassle intensity to mean uplift intensity ratio (MHI:MUI). Remission after treatment was not predicted by these baseline HUPS measures and did not moderate outcomes by treatment type. In contrast, HUPS measures significantly changed with treatment and were impacted by remission status. Specifically, HF and MHI:MUI decreased and UF increased from baseline to week 12, with remission leading to significantly greater decreases in HF and MHI:MUI compared to non-remission. ADM-treated patients demonstrated significant improvements on all three HUPS measures regardless of remission status. In contrast, remitters to CBT demonstrated significant improvements in HF and MHI:MUI but not UF; among CBT non-remitters the only significant change was a reduction in HF. The changes in HUPS measures are consistent with how affective biases are impacted by treatments and support the potential value of increasing attention to positive events in CBT.}

Protein levels were predicted from individual-level genotypes using genetic scores from the publicly available OmicsPred database, which estimated genetic scores based on genome-wide genotypes and proteomic measurements from the Olink and SomaScan platforms. Associations between predicted protein levels and treatment outcomes were assessed using logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders including population stratification. Results were meta-analysed using a random-effects model. The Bonferroni correction was applied. We analysed 257 proteins for Olink and 1502 for SomaScan; 111 proteins overlapped between the two platforms. Despite no association was significant after multiple-testing correction, many top results were consistent across phenotypes, in particular seven proteins were nominally associated with all the analysed outcomes (CHL1, DUSP13, EVA1C, FCRL2, KITLG, SMAP1, and TIM3/HAVCR2). Additionally, three proteins (CXCL6, IL5RA, and RARRES2) showed consistent nominal associations across both the Olink and SomaScan platforms. The convergence of results across phenotypes is in line with the hypothesis of the involvement of immune-inflammatory mechanisms and neuroplasticity in treatment response.

The results indicate that a renewable generation target leads to a reduction in net imports and electricity prices. Additionally, reduced market integration impacts both Swiss and European energy transitions by limiting trade benefits, underutilizing Variable Renewable Energy Sources (VRES), and increasing electricity supply costs.

abstract = {Background
Reward processing dysfunction is a core characteristic of major depressive disorder (MDD), yet event-related potential (ERP) research in MDD has predominantly focused on reward receipt as opposed to anticipation. The stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) ERP reflects anticipatory brain processing. This study examines whether individuals with MDD exhibit deficits during reward anticipation as evidenced by altered SPN amplitude.
Methods
We assessed prefeedback-SPN amplitudes during a monetary incentive delay (MID) task in individuals with MDD (n = 142, 99 with comorbid anxiety disorders [MDD + ANX]) compared to Controls (n = 37). A mixed analysis of variance was performed on prefeedback-SPN amplitude and behavioral measures, with group (MDD, MDD + ANX, Control) as the between-subjects factor, and feedback (gain, loss) and electrode (F3, F4, Fz, C3, C4, Cz, P3, P4, Pz) as within-subjects factors.
Results
A group main effect revealed faster reaction times for the Control group than MDD and MDD + ANX groups. A group x feedback interaction indicated that the MDD subgroup had smaller prefeedback-SPN amplitudes than MDD + ANX and Control groups when anticipating gain feedback. Additionally, individuals with current MDD, irrespective of past MDD and comorbid anxiety, exhibited smaller SPN amplitudes than Controls prior to gain feedback.
Limitations
The MID paradigm, designed for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquisition, lacks optimization for ERP analysis. Moreover, the clinical groups included more females than the Control group.
Conclusions
Reduced resource allocation to reward anticipation may differentiate MDD from MDD + ANX and Control groups. Further investigation of the neural mechanisms of distinct MDD phenotypes is warranted.}

abstract = {Peanut production in Argentina is predominantly rainfed, with considerable variability in rainfall patterns within and between seasons. This variability results in droughts of varying duration and severity, which can significantly reduce yields. Water availability is, therefore, a critical factor in determining the optimal sowing date. The objectives of this study were to (i) assess the effects of sowing dates and water gradients on peanut yield and crop traits at two representative sites in the central peanut-producing region, and (ii) identify management strategies that optimize yield under water-limited conditions. Seasonal and annual analyses were conducted, incorporating water availability at sowing, environmental conditions, site characteristics, management practices, and cultivars. The Cropping System Model CROPGRO-Peanut was employed to simulate the impacts of those factors. Seasonal analysis revealed that delayed sowing dates consistently led to yield reductions, irrespective of water availability, with decreases in seed number, maximum leaf area index, total biomass, and water use efficiency. These yield reductions were more pronounced under lower water availability at sowing. When sown late, annual analysis indicated that combining an early cultivar and progressively narrowing row spacing resulted in increased yields. In contrast, intermediate-cycle and late cultivars experienced yield declines due to lower radiation and temperature levels. Differences in yield were also explained by the varying contributions of transpiration and evaporation to total water use. Our findings underscore the importance of management decisions in influencing water use components, with soil water-holding capacity playing a key role in crop performance. This study provides valuable insights for developing adapted management practices to improve productivity in temperate regions under water-limited conditions.}

abstract = {Intercity Demand Responsive Transit (IDRT) systems, providing on-demand “door-to-door” services for intercity travelers, have been recently implemented in a few cities and gained popularity. To devise a theoretical tool for designing efficient IDRT systems, this study proposes a continuous approximation (CA) model to describe the operation metrics of the IDRT. In a two-city system, an optimization model is proposed to study the zoning strategies in the main city, the service area in the satellite city, and headways. The objective is to minimize the average system cost, including the costs of both the operators and the passengers. A two-stage partition algorithm is proposed to generate a near-optimal solution by combining the greedy algorithm and sensitivity-based coordination optimization method. Subsequently, we develop a direct solution algorithm to establish a lower bound for the optimal solution, facilitating a comparison with the near-optimal solution. Throughout all sensitivity analyses, the gaps between the near-optimal solution and the lower-bound solution remain below 3 %. The comparison results demonstrate that the computation time and solution quality of the two-stage partition algorithm are considered acceptable. Simulation is performed to test the validity of the CA model, and the errors in the average system costs are less than 1.16 %. Sensitivity analyses are carried out to evaluate the impacts of several key parameters (e.g., demand densities and line-haul distances) on the optimization results. By comparison with Intercity Fixed Route Transit (IFRT), it can be seen that the choice of IDRT depends on passengers' preference for door-to-door transportation. This study may serve as a valuable reference for the practical implementation of IDRT.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly transforming the modern world by connecting billions of devices that generate a continuous flow of data. Its rapid expansion has broadened applications from home automation to nearly every industry. Selecting an appropriate IoT architecture is increasingly challenging due to the complexity of components, interactions, and diverse application requirements. Ensuring that an IoT architecture meets performance, reliability, and resource constraints before deployment is essential for avoiding inefficiencies and bottlenecks. Emulating IoT architectures during the design phase allows architects to test different IoT architectures and assess system performance under various conditions. This helps ensure optimal resource utilization and responsiveness. Several simulation approaches, particularly those based on Model-Driven Development (MDD), have been proposed to model and analyse IoT environments. These methodologies provide high-level abstractions of complex IoT architectures, enabling systematic experimentation and evaluation. This work introduces a novel methodology and tools for simulating and refining IoT architectures using a evolutionary approach. They allow architects to assess and improve performance based on configurable parameters such as latency and CPU usage. Through iterative IoT architecture modifications and testing, the proposed MDD-based approach optimizes system design, ensuring that the final architecture is fine-tuned to deliver the best possible performance for a given application. The proposal is validated by a case study related with a smart parking.}

This study investigated the association of polygenic scores (PGSs) for seven subcortical brain volumes (including the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and caudate nucleus) with treatment non-response and non-remission in MDD. Patients with MDD were recruited in the context of five clinical studies, including a total of 3637 individuals. PGSs were estimated using a Bayesian framework and continuous shrinkage priors (PRS-CS-auto) after standard genotype quality control and imputation. Logistic regressions were performed between PGSs and non-response or non-remission in each sample, adjusting for age, sex, baseline symptom severity, recruitment sites, and population stratification. Results were meta-analysed across samples, using a random-effect model. No association was significant in the meta-analysis after Bonferroni correction. The top finding was found for the caudate volume PGS and non-remission (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01–1.19, p = 0.036), with no evidence of heterogeneity. Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses showed that this result was influenced by the two largest samples in the meta-analysis. This result should be considered as preliminary as it did not reach the Bonferroni-adjusted significance threshold. Future studies with greater statistical power may enhance the predictive performance of PGSs and contribute to the identification of polygenic predictors of treatment outcomes in MDD, contributing to precision psychiatry.}

abstract = {Electrical short circuits pose significant challenges in power systems and electronics, where traditional models often fail to accurately capture the dynamic behavior of voltage, current, and resistance during fault events. The problem stems from the assumption that short circuit currents tend towards infinite values, based on exponential growth models, and the limitation of current protection systems in providing precise measurements or preventing backflow currents. This paper introduces a novel framework for measuring and understanding short circuit phenomena, challenging these conventional assumptions. The objective is to present a new experimental and theoretical approach for short circuit analysis, incorporating time-varying resistance and current. The presented framework involves an unconventional measurement system based on a Modified Ohm’s Law and a parallel diode configuration. Experiments were conducted over 3-minute durations with data recorded at 1-second intervals using an Arduino Microcontroller. This system captures real-time electrical quantities during a short circuit event, providing a more accurate representation compared to traditional instantaneous models. The paper results demonstrate that, contrary to traditional models, short circuit currents converge to finite values rather than tending to infinity. Higher initial supply voltages lead to higher short circuit currents, with voltage and resistance stabilizing at constant values. These observations lead to the introduction of two new characteristic properties: “minimal short voltage” and “minimal short resistance”, which describe the stabilized values observed during a short circuit and challenge traditional fault conditions. The novelty of this paper lies in the development of a continuous, time-dependent framework for short circuit analysis, offering a universal model applicable to a wide range of systems. The findings have significant implications for improving short circuit protection systems, enabling more reliable and accurate detection and enhancing the understanding of electrical short circuits under dynamic conditions.}

Here, we report combined findings on untargeted metabolomics, inflammation markers in serum, mitochondrial respiration in peripheral blood immune cells, and measures of oxidative stress, along with psychometric assessments in a female outpatient cohort (n = 19) compared to non-depressed female controls (n = 23). We used Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WCNA) to identify metabolite clusters differentiating depressed and non-depressed individuals. Furthermore, WCNA revealed associations between biological parameters – previously associated with major depression − and the identified metabolite clusters. Including all identified metabolites, our results showed separation between participants with depression and non-depressed controls. WCNA identified ten metabolite clusters positively correlated with depression and one negatively correlated cluster. Several clusters indicated alterations in lipids and metabolites related to oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and inflammation, underscoring the significance of inflammatory activity and oxidative stress in depression. Subsequent pathway analysis assigned the metabolites to sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid, and glycerolipid metabolism, highlighting potential targets for further research and intervention. This study supports the view of depression as a pathophysiological condition associated with alterations in several biological parameters and reinforces previous findings on the role of lipid metabolism in depression, alongside alterations in inflammatory activity and mitochondrial bioenergetics. The data also revealed correlations between bacterial and plant metabolites and MDD, suggesting impaired gut epithelial integrity in depression.}

One obvious strategy is to improve model structures utilising advancements in process knowledge and observations. Another statistically relevant approach is to develop improved error models so that the uncertainty can be more reliably estimated. The recently introduced river bed/bank storage (RBS) model is an improved representation of transmission losses/gains within basin-scale river system models. The novelty of the current research is the way the RBS model is combined with State and Parameter Uncertainty Estimation (SPUE) to produce more statistically reliable predictions. Using the RBS model with SPUE resulted in better matched predictive distributions in 13 out of 16 test cases, and higher proportions of observed values within the predictive ranges for all cases. The paper demonstrates that improving model structures combined with better characterisation of state error can alleviate issues of overfitting in predictions.}

We quantify the effects of these policy measures on regional fuel consumption and carbon emissions. We model the resulting emissions and fuel savings on the supply side using an optimization model representing Saudi Arabia's power generation sector. We estimate that between 2016 and 2019, electricity demand decreased by 8.8% per year on average following price reforms, resulting in USD 1.4 billion in fuel savings. International oil prices would bring the total savings up to USD 9.8 billion. Moreover, we show that the two waves of reforming electricity prices avoided 81–102 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, i.e., a potential increase of 8.2%–10.4% of the power sector's emissions. Our results for Saudi Arabia demonstrate the benefits of reforming energy prices for countries with administered tariffs as an effective tool to reduce inefficient demand and carbon emissions to achieve climate pledges.}

Existing literature lacks comprehensive vehicle-to-grid (V2G) impact analyses and methodologies for long-term integration, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, the absence of optimized short-term operational models for EV integration poses challenges in grid management. To bridge these gaps, this research proposes a socio-economic model to estimate EV sales based on the Bass diffusion model and macroeconomic regressions. Additionally, it integrates electricity system expansion planning using the OSeMOSYS tool with a short-term operational model based on unit commitment. In this context, this work endeavors to develop a methodology for estimating the impact of V2G technology, considering both the deployment and utilization of EVs in a Brazilian case study. Applying traditional methodologies that do not consider operational system models can lead to potential future load shedding. It may accentuate disparities between long-term and short-term outcomes, especially with EV and V2G integration. The proposed methodology corrected the overestimation of the energy injection potential of EVs by the traditional model, indicating the need to consider both the expansion and the operation of the electricity system when planning the integration of EVs.}

To address the cooling and heating needs of the residential building, an Electrical Compression Chiller was integrated into system. The primary objective of this research is to establish a framework for a zero-energy building by leveraging a wind power installation to provide the energy demands of the residential building. Simulations of residential building were conducted using BEopt software. The proposed wind power facility includes a wind turbine (WT), compressed air energy storage (CAES), gas turbine (GT), and an Electrical compression chiller (ECC), all evaluated within the context of Rome's climate. System modeling utilized EES thermodynamic software, while optimization was performed using the response surface method alongside Minitab software. The optimize the model configuration achieved an exergy efficiency (ERTE) of 30.85 % and a cost rate of 159.90 $/hour, indicating that ten wind turbines represent the ideal number for establishing a wind farm in this context. A case study was carried out to assess the system's performance under Rome's climatic conditions, revealing its capability to generate 25,174,907.69 kWh of electricity, 17,691,708.55 kWh of heating, and 12,656,684.01 kWh of cooling annually. This setup could potentially reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 5135.681 tons and facilitate the expansion of 24 ha of green space in Rome. Additionally, BEopt optimization expressions were employed to simulate residential buildings in two selected cities. The findings indicated that annual energy consumption for electricity, heating, and cooling in the residential building was 1,216,637 kWh, 277,976 kWh, and 932,739.5 kWh respectively. A comparison between the buildings' energy consumption and the system's production confirmed that the proposed wind power facility can adequately meet the energy demands of the five-story residential building throughout the year while allowing for surplus energy storage for alternative uses.}

The work presents a mathematical model and a multi-step calculation algorithm for determining the optimum tilt angle of a photovoltaic system, with the tilt angle ranging from 0° to 90°. The model describes the system’s energy balance and enables its analytical identification under varying conditions. An extended modelling algorithm using Laplace transform was developed to validate the analytical model, with further verification carried out through the application of an artificial neural network. A complex simulation procedure was carried out for a tilt angle of 25°, including statistical evaluation of the relationship between the parameters of the analytical model and those of the model defined in a complex variable domain, across different time periods. Statistical significance of the observed differences in key quantification indices was assessed. The results confirmed a high level of validity 93.9% of the original model and demonstrated the practical applicability of the proposed modelling procedure and verification method using complex variable. Furthermore, the framework integrateseconomic assessment, revealed that tilt angles around 25° provide the highest energy yield (5230 kWh/year) and best net present value (€14,707), whereas vertical panels reduce energy yield by up to 16.2%.The proposed framework therefore providesa rigorous technical basis and economic justificationfor optimised PV system design under Central European climatic conditions.}

The growing demand for grid decarbonization and changes in the resource mix have led to an increase in IBR adoption, mostly replacing conventional generators. IBR’s proliferation introduces more uncertainties to the operation of power grids, making it more challenging to maintain frequency or voltage stability and necessitating more robust grid stability decision support systems. Model-free artificial neural network-based solutions have been proposed to provide operators with situational awareness and decision-making capabilities during regular operations and contingencies. These solutions, however, may become inaccurate if their input system state is attacked, for instance, by falsifying input data or by noisy measurements. Therefore, a comprehensive support system that detects and responds to perturbed system states is essential for power system operators to rely on these solutions. This paper proposes an attack-resistant solution for assisting operators during Q-V scheduling circumstances using generative adversarial neural network (GAN) architecture combined with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Voltage stability indices are incorporated into the proposed DRL framework to ensure the voltage stability of the grid. Using the modified IEEE 30-Bus transmission system, the proposed architecture is evaluated for different operational scenarios, and its ability to protect against falsified system states while facilitating voltage stability is demonstrated.}

Growing hydrogen demand for decarbonization has fueled interest in North Africa's potential to export green hydrogen to Europe. Using the eTIMES-EUNA model, this study examines how demand, trade, and RES development challenges shape the energy landscapes of both regions. The findings indicate that hydrogen demand amplifies renewable electricity requirements in both regions, with Europe particularly benefiting from importing hydrogen to alleviate additional RES capacity installation. Hydrogen trade reduces overall costs by 1 %, yet it shifts a considerable financial burden onto North Africa, demanding a rapid RES capacity expansion at a rate significantly higher than the current pace. Slower RES development in North Africa could hinder the region's ability to meet both domestic and export targets, thereby complicating Europe's hydrogen sourcing strategies, which are also challenged by social acceptance issues that limit RES deployment. These constraints in Europe necessitate adjustments to the technological mix and place additional pressure on North Africa to increase production. Furthermore, the varying implications and stakes at the national level highlight the need for further analysis, as individual countries may prioritize their own interests, potentially leading to conflicts with neighboring nations under different development schemes. Consequently, the results underscore the importance of coordinated financial and policy support to ensure equitable trade that aligns with both regions' sustainability goals.}

Primary outcomes included improvement in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and remission. Secondary analyses included the use of the self-rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) to assess for changes in atypical neurovegetative symptoms. Multiple linear regression, multiple logistic regression, and linear mixed effects analyses were performed. 46 % (58/127) of the sample had a seasonal pattern. Seasonal pattern did not significantly influence improvement in HAMD (PIDS < 12, 7.8, SD 5.9; PIDS ≥ 12, 10.4, SD 4.9 or remission (PIDS < 12, 30 %; PIDS ≥ 12, 34 %). There were equivalent degrees of improvement in atypical neurovegetative symptoms over time as assessed using the QIDS. Depression with seasonal pattern was found to respond to rTMS treatment similarly to depression without seasonal pattern, suggesting that this may be a viable treatment for this group.}

abstract = {Background
A diagnostic criterion for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is difficulty concentrating and increased distractibility. One form of distraction that occurs in everyday life is mind-wandering. The current study aims to test how individuals with MDD and healthy controls differ in their mind-wandering in everyday life.
Methods
Adults diagnosed with MDD (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 53) completed a week of experience sampling, with prompts administered up to eight times per day. At each prompt, participants reported the occurrence and characteristics of their mind-wandering. They also reported levels of momentary negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA), and rumination.
Results
MDD participants reported mind-wandering almost twice as often as healthy control participants. Compared to healthy participants, MDD participants rated their mind-wandering as more negative, but did not differ in terms of temporal orientation. Higher NA and lower PA predicted mind-wandering in the MDD group but not healthy controls, even after controlling for rumination. Time-lagged analyses revealed that current mind-wandering predicted future levels of PA in MDD participants but not in healthy controls; in contrast, current NA and PA did not predict future mind-wandering.
Limitations
Limitations include our examination of specific forms of mind-wandering (i.e., we did not sample the full spectrum of this construct).
Conclusions
Individuals with MDD frequently report engaging in mind-wandering in everyday life, and this appears to be coupled with affect. Mind-wandering may have maladaptive effects in MDD and could serve as a target for intervention.}

abstract = {Permafrost wetlands are critical and vulnerable components of northern ecosystems, with their methane (CH4) emissions representing a major uncertainty in Earth system models. Previous syntheses have disagreed on how permafrost continuity modulates CH4 fluxes, leaving a blind spot in climate projections. We hypothesize that degradation of permafrost continuity from continuous to discontinuous to sporadic creates a gradient of environmental conditions that drives an exponential shift in CH4 emissions. To test this, we synthesized 153 growing-season CH4 flux observations from 40 global permafrost wetland studies. Our analysis reveals a clear emission gradient: continuous, discontinuous, and sporadic permafrost wetlands exhibited median CH4 fluxes of 0.09, 0.24, and 4.73 mg CH4 m−2 h−1, respectively. Water-table depth (WT) emerged as the dominant predictor of CH4 flux (XGBoost RMSE = 0.78 mg CH4 m−2 h−1, R2 = 0.59), with a nonlinear threshold at ∼–10 cm. Fluxes were negligible below this depth but increased markedly above it, indicating a hydrological tipping point. Structural equation modelling showed that the composite permafrost factor (β = 0.26) and hydrological conditions (β = 0.26) jointly explained ≈0.37 of the total R2 = 0.48. Environmental analyses highlighted systematic shifts across categories: sporadic sites had the shallowest WT (−4.73 cm) and deepest active layers (115.3 cm), conditions that expand methanogenic soil volumes while compressing oxidation zones. Continuous sites showed higher soil bulk density and pH, whereas sporadic sites accumulated more organic matter. These biophysical changes, coupled with vegetation turnover, further modulated CH4 dynamics: tree-dominated sites suppressed emissions, while sedge-dominated zones enhanced them under wetter conditions. Together, our findings demonstrate a cascading, nonlinear relationship linking permafrost degradation, thaw depth, hydrology, microbial processes, and vegetation to CH4 flux. This mechanistic understanding underscores the need to integrate permafrost–hydrology–microbe–vegetation feedback into models to reduce uncertainty in Arctic methane–climate projections.}

A widely used method for operating on-site storage is model predictive control (MPC), whose effectiveness heavily depends on forecast accuracy. This paper systematically evaluates the impact of prediction models on MPC performance in smart energy storage systems (SESS). Using a three-year, multi-building dataset with 15 min resolution, we compare five forecasting methods, linear model, XGBoost, RNN, TimeMixer, and TimesNet, for load, PV generation, and electricity price prediction. While XGBoost achieves the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and yields the highest revenue gain of 104% over a no-storage baseline during a four-month winter–spring test period, other models reveal a mismatch between forecast accuracy and control performance. Notably, the linear model, ranking mostly lowest in MSE, delivers the third-highest revenue (73%), nearly on par with the second best (79%). This illustrates that prediction accuracy alone is not a reliable proxy for control quality. Even the best realistic setup remains far from the ideal benchmark using perfect forecasts (235% gain). Daily retraining improves some models substantially (linear model to 105%) but has limited effect on others (XGBoost to 107%). These findings emphasize three key insights: (1) standard metrics like MSE may misrepresent the utility of forecasts for control, (2) errors across multiple inputs compound degradation in MPC, and (3) frequent retraining can mitigate losses. Overall, the results underscore the importance of robust forecasting and carefully chosen loss functions in the smart energy systems concept.}

Using the multi-energy system model ISAaR, we analyze fourteen scenarios with different levels of vRES expansion, including an evaluation of the resulting hydrogen prices. The load-weighted average European hydrogen price in the BASE scenario decreases from 4.1 €/kg in 2030 to 3.3 €/kg by 2050. Results show that delaying the expansion of vRES significantly increases the demand for imports of hydrogen and its derivatives and thus increases the risk of not meeting GHG emission targets for two reasons: (1) higher import volumes to meet GHG emission targets increase dependence on third parties and lead to higher risk in terms of security of supply; (2) at the same time, lower vRES expansion in combination with higher import volumes leads to higher resulting hydrogen prices, which in turn affects the economic viability of the energy transition. In contrast, an accelerated expansion of vRES reduces dependency on imports and stabilizes hydrogen prices below 3 €/kg in 2050, which increases planning security for hydrogen off-takers. The study underlines the importance of timely and strategic progress in the expansion of vRES and investment in hydrogen production, storage and transport networks to minimize dependence on imports and effectively meet the European climate targets.}

One possibility is seen in the export of green hydrogen. Using Algeria as a case study, this paper analyses how different levels of ambition in hydrogen exports, energy efficiency and fuel switching affect the cost-optimal expansion of the power sector for a given overall emissions reduction path. Despite falling costs for photovoltaics and wind turbines, the results indicate that in countries with very low natural gas prices, such as Algeria, a fully renewable electricity system by 2050 is unlikely without appropriate policy measures. The expansion of renewable energy should therefore start early, given the high annual growth rates required, which will be reinforced by additional green hydrogen exports. In parallel, energy efficiency is a key factor as it directly mitigates CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and reduces domestic electricity demand, which could instead be used for hydrogen production. Integrating electrolysers into the power system could potentially help to reduce specific costs through load shifting. Overall, it seems advisable to analyse hydrogen exports together with local decarbonisation in order to better understand their interactions and to reduce emissions as efficiently as possible. These results and the methodology could be transferred to other countries that want to become green hydrogen exporters in the future and are therefore a useful addition for researchers and policy makers.}

Despite this, few studies explore the simultaneous impacts of decarbonising both sectors. This paper aims to examine how industrial decarbonisation in Europe affects the energy system and vice versa. To address this, an industry model incorporating key heavy industry sectors across six European countries is combined with an energy system model for electricity and hydrogen covering fifteen European regions, referred to as the EU-15, divided into eleven zones. The study evaluates various policy scenarios under different conditions. The results demonstrate that industrial decarbonisation leads to a significant increase in electricity and hydrogen demand. This additional demand for electricity is largely met through renewable energy sources, while hydrogen supply is predominantly addressed by blue hydrogen production when fossil fuels are authorised and the system lacks renewable energy. This increased demand results in higher prices with considerable regional disparities. Furthermore, the findings reveal that, regardless of the scenario, the electricity mix in the EU-15 remains predominantly renewable, exceeding 85%. A reduction in carbon taxes lowers the prices of electricity and hydrogen, but does not increase consumption, as the lower carbon tax makes the continued use of fossil fuels more attractive to industry. In scenarios that enforce a phase-out of fossil fuels, electricity prices rise, leading to a greater reliance on imports of low-carbon hydrogen and methanol. Results also suggest that domestic hydrogen production benefits from synergies between electrolytic hydrogen and blue hydrogen, helping to maintain competitive prices.}

We used an urban building energy model and an electric distribution system model to evaluate active and passive cooling measures. The most effective space cooling measures were high-performance air-source heat pumps, cool coatings, window films, and harnessing the space cooling effect from heat pump water heaters. The results show that combining heat pump water heaters with window films and cool coatings reduces heat index hazard hours within buildings by 95 % to 99 % but increases total energy costs (equipment costs plus changes in utility bills) by 20 % to 60 % where the higher end includes building electrical upgrades. These measures also led to increased space heater use during colder months to avoid overcooling. Replacing conventional heaters with air source heat pumps eliminated unsafe indoor temperatures and reduced total energy use, but increased cost by 125 % to 150 %. In total, using heat pumps for space and water heating could reduce primary energy use by up to 57 %. The higher cost of active and passive cooling measures can be mitigated by existing and emerging incentive programs, especially those that support heat pumps. Electric distribution upgrades to support community electrification are estimated to increase utility costs by $25 to $40 per ratepayer per year. The results underscore the potential and challenges of adapting building infrastructure in communities at risk from climate and environmental stressors.}

To evaluate biomarkers that assist in the identification of electroencephalography signals in patients with depression, utilizing an ensemble learning model.
Methods:
XGBoost ensemble model was trained and tested to classify patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n=24) and healthy controls (HCs) (n=29) from the multi-modal open dataset for mental-disorder analysis. Based on event-related potentials (ERPs) to emotional-neutral face pairs (Happy-Neutral, Sad-Neutral, Fear-Neutral) as stimuli, we segmented six conditions: 3 emotional cues, dots (happy, sad, and fear) and applied the FisherScore feature selection method to select the waveform features with high mutual information. Overall, 80% of the data was selected to establish the XGBoost model with five-fold cross-validation.
Results:
We identified happy, sad and fear conditions with waveform features (170–230 s) to distinguish patients with depression. The proposed XGBoost model had a comprehensive accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under curve of 99.52%, 99.39%, 99.67%, 99.52%, and 99.98% for the ERPs. Furthermore, our experimental results indicated that suppression of the amplitude of negative emotional cues could be used to recognize depression, which was predominantly over the frontal lobe and frontal poles regions. The response latency of ERP signals contributed significantly to distinguishing between HCs and patients with MDD.
Conclusion:
An ensemble learning system for classification using the XGBoost and feature selection using FisherScore has the potential to be used in clinical prediction of depressive symptoms in patients with MDD.
Significance:
The discovery of ERPs as a biomarker has important clinical implications for exploring the pathogenesis behind MDD.}

Dynamic analysis is a prominent approach for understanding the real-behavior of Android malware. Malware mainly use evasions to underperform dynamic analysis. Although different approaches have been proposed to tackle evasive malware, they suffer from several limitations, e.g. most of them use static analysis to detect the evasions which can be defeated by using anti static analysis techniques. On the other hand, to defeat the evasions, they use different execution methods that cause crashes in some cases. To address the challenges of detecting and defeating malware evasions, we propose Maaker, a novel framework that utilizes both static and dynamic analyses through hybrid execution along with a human in the loop approach. Maaker takes advantage of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) to facilitate putting the human in the loop in order to use his/her knowledge to tackle different evasions for extracting the real malicious behavior with little effort. Maaker is compared with Ares, IntelliDroid and Defuzer tools. We used malware samples from AMD dataset to compare the tools regarding some criteria including the number of detected evasions, reached targets, required executions, and the time required to reach the targets. Evaluation results show that Maaker outperforms the three rival tools regarding effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.}

The long-term effectiveness of vortioxetine for facilitating progress toward personal recovery goals and improving productivity at work was assessed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
Methods
Single-arm, prospective, 24-week cohort study in employed patients with MDD initiating treatment with vortioxetine (n = 121) in outpatient settings in Japan. The Goal Attainment Scale for Depression (GAS-D) was used to evaluate progress toward personal recovery goals. At baseline, a combination of patient-defined and pre-specified goals was established collaboratively with the treating psychiatrist, followed by longitudinal assessments at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. Work-related productivity was assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire. Co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving their pre-specified personal recovery goals at week 12 and the change in work productivity from baseline.
Results
In all, 45/107 patients (42.1%) had achieved their personal recovery goals at week 12, increasing to 62/100 (62.0%) at week 24. Significant improvement was observed across all WPAI domains (i.e., absenteeism, presenteeism, productivity loss, and activity impairment) at week 24. Depressive symptoms, global patient functioning, emotional and cognitive symptoms, cognitive performance, and quality of life also significantly improved over the 24 weeks of follow-up. At week 24, 80/102 patients (78.4%) remained on vortioxetine; 49 of these patients (61.3%) were receiving vortioxetine 20 mg/day.
Limitations
Open-label study.
Conclusions
Vortioxetine was found to be effective in helping to achieve personal recovery goals and in enhancing workplace productivity over the 6-month study period in patients with MDD.

abstract = {In the Industry 5.0 paradigm, mass customization and personalized production models have gained significant traction. Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) advancements have revolutionized product design methodologies. However, dynamic uncertainty in complex product customization processes presents escalating challenges. This study proposes an Intelligent Customized Design (ICD) framework for complex products under dynamic uncertainty, integrating Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) with advanced computational intelligence. Firstly, an ICD modeling architecture based on System Modeling Language is developed to manage dynamic uncertainty through parametric feedback loops and scenario-driven validation. A tripartite uncertainty mitigation strategy is formulated to address three key challenges building on this architecture: requirement volatility, conceptual space ambiguity, and solution convergence issues. Advanced algorithms are employed to operationalize this strategy—cloud models for clarifying fuzzy requirements, FP-growth for reconstruction of conceptual design space, and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for optimizing real-time decision-making. Finally, the framework is empirically validated using a high-speed train bogie case study, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving enterprise responsiveness to market heterogeneity. The findings establish a systematic approach for AI-driven customization intelligence, bridging MBSE rigor with adaptive design reasoning under uncertainty.}

This study investigated the effects of accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS) on SC-FC coupling and graph theory measures, focusing on the association between baseline SC-FC coupling of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and clinical improvement. In a randomized, sham-controlled, quadruple-blind, crossover study, aiTBS was delivered to the left dlPFC of depressed patients with MDD, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data were acquired. In 77 MDD patients, significantly increased whole-brain SC-FC coupling was observed, primarily driven by default mode network (DMN) SC-FC coupling, along with increased somatomotor network FC, and decreased FC between the DMN hubs and limbic regions after active aiTBS. Furthermore, significant increases were observed in structural global and local efficiency measures that were not specific to the stimulation condition (active/sham aiTBS). However, these changes did not significantly correlate with clinical improvement. Notably, baseline SC-FC coupling of the left dlPFC was a significant predictor of clinical improvement. Our findings highlight the potential of left dlPFC SC-FC coupling as a predictor of aiTBS treatment outcomes, as well as the effect of aiTBS in enhancing SC-FC coupling.}

Given Brazil's high hydropower storage capacity and the strong seasonal patterns of its renewable resources, introducing Seasonal Pumped Hydropower Storage (SPHS) can help mitigate these challenges. To this end, a methodology is proposed that links the dynamic system-optimization model – MESSAGEix - to regional climate model simulations, called the Brazilian Electricity System MESSAGEix Model (BESMM). This model, with its detailed hydropower representation, is capable of integrating data from three climate change scenarios with the country's energy system. Climate change introduces a new dimension to this approach, as there is evidence of increasing the seasonal imbalance of variable renewable resources in Brazil. BESMM results suggest that SPHS can play a fundamental role in achieving a 100 % renewable matrix by 2100 in RCP 2.6 scenario, as well as enhancing the renewable energy endowment in scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. A reduction of up to 68 % of CO2 emissions is predicted in scenarios incorporating SPHS, compared to scenarios without SPHS.}

To ensure that hydrogen production aligns with these goals, the European Commission has introduced criteria for additionality, temporal correlation, and geographical correlation. These criteria are designed to ensure that hydrogen production from renewable sources supports the growth of renewable energy. This study assesses the impact of these criteria on green hydrogen production, focusing on production costs and technology impacts. The European energy market is simulated up to 2048 using stochastic programming, applying these requirements exclusively to green hydrogen production without the phased-in compliance period outlined in the EU regulations. The findings show that meeting the criteria will increase expected system costs by €82 billion from 2024 to 2048, largely due to the rapid shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The additionality requirement, which mandates the use of new renewable energy installations for electrolysis, proves to be the most expensive, but also the most effective in accelerating renewable energy adoption.}

The current study used a retrospective study design to investigate the association between age of onset of severe mental disorders in offspring and the likelihood of diagnoses of parental mental disorder.
Method
We enrolled 212,333 people with severe mental disorder, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BD), or major depressive disorder (MDD) and 2,123,329 controls matched for age, sex, and demographics from the National Health Insurance Database of Taiwan. Poisson regression models were used to examine the likelihood of diagnoses of five mental disorders in their parents compared to the parents of the controls (reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval), including schizophrenia, BD, MDD, alcohol use disorder (AUD), and substance use disorder (SUD). The study cohort was classified into child-onset, adolescent-onset, and adult-onset groups according to the onset of severe mental disorders in the offspring.
Result
The parents of people with child-, adolescent-, and adult-onset schizophrenia (OR range: 1.73–9.08, all p < 0.05) or BD (OR range: 1.97–8.17, all p < 0.05) were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, BD, MDD, AUD, and substance use disorder (SUD) than controls except for AUD in the child-onset group. However, the parents of people with child-, adolescent-, and adult-onset depressive disorder were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, BD, MDD, AUD, and SUD (OR range: 1.82–4.76, all p < 0.05) than controls. Sub-analyses stratified by sex showed different patterns of associations between parental mental disorders and offspring mental disorders.
Conclusion
No matter when the severe mental disorder of the offsprings occurred at different onset stages, their parents had a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with schizophrenia, BD, MDD, AUD, and SUD.}

abstract = {Background
Repetitive negative thinking (RNT), particularly its brooding aspect, is a prominent feature in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with and without comorbid anxiety. Error processing, an adaptive cognitive operation, seems to be impaired in individuals with exaggerated RNT. This study measured a post-error neural response, error-related negativity (ERN), during an inhibitory task to examine the mechanism underlying the relationship between RNT and faulty error processing.
Methods
We examined current MDD patients with (n = 61) and without comorbid anxiety disorders (COM; n = 38), propensity-matched into High- or Low-RNT groups according to Ruminative Response Scale Brooding subscale scores. Using 32-channel electroencephalography (EEG) during a stop-signal task, we measured baseline-corrected ERN amplitude at FCz 0–100 ms after an incorrect response. A between-subjects ANOVA was conducted with group (High RNT, Low RNT) and comorbidity (MDD, COM) as factors.
Results
A significant group-by-comorbidity interaction (η2 = 0.07) was found, with MDD participants exhibiting high RNT revealing smaller (more positive) ERN amplitudes compared to their COM counterparts with high RNT (d = 0.77) and MDD participants with low RNT (d = 0.92).
Conclusions
Non-anxious individuals with MDD and high RNT showed blunted post-error neural responses, potentially indicating a diminished adaptive neural mechanism for recognizing and correcting errors. However, the presence of comorbid anxiety disorders in individuals with high RNT appears to counteract this reduction, potentially through an enhanced neural response to errors, thereby maintaining a higher level of error-processing activity. Further understanding of these relationships is essential for developing targeted interventions for MDD, with particular focus on the detrimental impact of brooding RNT.}

abstract = {Europe's ambitious climate goals highlight the importance of combining energy policies with technological decarbonization; however, these efforts alone may not achieve the necessary emissions reductions. Existing models for low-carbon transitions often focus on technological interventions, without fully integrating the decarbonization potential of behavioural shifts towards sufficient consumption. A comprehensive model that incorporates both sufficiency and technological measures, with realistic adoption rates for sufficiency actions, is essential to effectively evaluate climate targets' feasibility. This study introduces a multi-regional, multi-sectoral model, based on an input-output framework, to quantify the decarbonization impacts of sufficiency measures on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and employment under European Union (EU) specific scenarios through 2050. The model evaluates six sufficiency measures: reductions in air travel, personal living space, and vehicle size; increased product and space sharing; greater cycling adoption; and a shift towards plant-based diets. Combined, these measures may reduce EU annual GHG emissions by up to 13 %, yielding global cumulative savings of 13.8 Gt CO₂eq by 2050, while having moderate first-order effects on GDP and employment. However, most of the emissions reductions stem from dietary changes and reduced air travel, while other measures – such as car downsizing and cycling – show limited effects due to their dependence on concurrent projected electrification and decarbonization of the energy system. The findings indicate that dietary changes and reductions in air travel provide the most substantial and resilient emissions reductions, making them critical priorities for policy support.}

This study aims to address this issue by integrating machine learning algorithms with EnergyPLAN and EPLANopt, a coupling of EnergyPLAN software and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, to expedite the optimization process while maintaining accuracy. By saving computational time, we can increase the number of evaluations, thereby enabling deeper exploration of uncertainty in energy system modelling. Although machine learning models have been widely employed as surrogate models to accelerate optimization problems, their application in energy system modeling at the national scale, while preserving high temporal resolution and extensive sector-coupling, remains scarce. Several machine learning models were evaluated, and an artificial neural network was selected as the most effective surrogate model. The findings demonstrate that incorporating this surrogate model within the optimization process reduces computational time by 64 % compared to the conventional EPLANopt approach, while maintaining an accuracy level close to that obtained by running EPLANopt without the surrogate model.}

Energy and mass balances are derived for the electrolyzer stack, heat exchangers, and gas–liquid separation vessels. These balances, along with semiempirical submodels, are integrated and solved within MATLAB system blocks connected through a Simulink environment. The model is validated using experimental data obtained from a comparable industrial plant with similar pressure, power, and system design parameters. The PEM plant is capable of operating within a pressure range of 5–55 bar. The electrochemical and thermal behaviors, along with hydrogen production, are compared between the process model and the actual PEM plant to assess the accuracy of the simulations. The results demonstrate a satisfactory agreement between the model predictions and experimental data. In nominal operation, 68.5% of the total power supplied to the stack is converted into hydrogen, while the remaining power is dissipated as heat due to overvoltages. This excess heat is primarily transferred through the heat exchangers to the secondary leg.}

Currently, most EMS are designed and evaluated using non-standardized and incompatible simulation models built within the specific EMS development cycle. Such evaluation techniques make it difficult to compare different EMS solutions according to well-defined and universal performance indicators. Therefore, open-access benchmark models of realistic building energy systems would be beneficial for wider research community. This article introduces the ProHMo benchmarking framework which provides experimentally validated commercial heating and cooling equipment models in various building energy system configurations. The building energy system models are available as openly accessible Functional Mock-Up Units (FMU) to allow for toolchain-independent benchmarking of EMS. The framework includes a Python code template that enables easy integration with different EMS interfaces. In a case study, we show the potential of the benchmarking framework by comparing a rule-based, optimization-based, and reinforcement learning-based EMS. The results show that the optimization-based EMS with perfect foresight achieves the lowest costs. Although the reinforcement learning-based EMS performs slightly poorer, it operates independently of forecasts, which makes it attractive for practical applications. The ProHMo benchmarking framework is designed to equip researchers with a robust framework for developing, evaluating, and comparing different EMS, particularly those focused on optimization and data-driven control methods.}

This study addresses this gap with an energy system model that couples high spatial and temporal resolution with realistic operational constraints under diverse future climate and technology scenarios. The New York State energy system and climate-energy policy are used to examine distinct spatial and temporal vulnerabilities stemming from interactions among renewable resource availability, evolving load patterns, and major transmission congestion. Analysis indicates a need for 60%–105% additional clean-firm capacity to maintain reliability. Increasing renewable capacity alone is insufficient due to transmission constraints and variations in spatial and temporal vulnerabilities.

However, efficient process optimization and wider adoption are hindered by the lack of reliable models to accurately predict deposit morphology from print parameters prior to deposition. Manufacturers currently rely on post-process inspection and iterative parameter tuning to achieve the desired deposit morphology. To address this, we present a conditional generative adversarial network (AJP-cGAN) designed to generate high-resolution images of deposit morphologies conditioned on key print parameters, thereby facilitating rapid identification of viable process windows. The AJP-cGAN was trained on microscopic images of deposits from a commercial AJP system. Model performance was validated against experimental data using qualitative and quantitative comparisons employing standard image similarity metrics and AJP-specific morphological descriptors. Single-factor studies were conducted to evaluate the model's ability to capture known process-structure relationships in AJP. The model's generalizability was tested by predicting outcomes for unseen process conditions, with results discussed across three representative scenarios. Our results demonstrate that AJP-cGAN reproduces experimental morphological features with good fidelity, establishing a validated data-driven link for predicting deposit morphology directly from print parameters prior to deposition.}

Efficient version management of models in model-driven software engineering is vital for modeling tools, necessitating model matching, differencing, and merging to incorporate various model versions. Although similarity-based matching is the most general method, its computational complexity escalates at a cubic rate with the number of elements.
Objective:
This paper introduces StEqMatch, a subtree-equivalence-based approach to accelerate similarity model matching, inspired by the observation that consecutive version changes typically impact only a small portion of a model.
Methods:
StEqMatch initially decomposes a model into a series of subtrees. Rather than performing element-wise matching directly, our approach tries to find equivalent (i.e., either identical or closely similar) subtrees, representing the unchanged portion of a model, thus enabling quick pairing of elements within these subtrees. To effectively identify equivalent subtrees, this paper develops two hash functions for equality and similarity comparison of model trees.
Results:
Experiments using open-source Ecore and UML models indicate that StEqMatch is 1.27 to 22.5 times faster on average compared to the state-of-the-art model matching tool while reducing the error rates in most cases.
Conclusion:
StEqMatch combines subtree matching and element-wise matching, and can improve the efficiency and the quality of similarity-based model matching.}

The study enhances e-cooking literature by specifically examining the integration of electric pressure cooker (EPC) demand into scalable photovoltaic mini-grids (PVMGs) designed under a comprehensive approach – to address electricity and cooking needs – and long-term sustainability. Using HOMER Pro, a recognized power system modelling software, to optimize the MG from the load profile, the study assesses the benefits, challenges and open issues, with a particular focus on access levels achieved, costs and environmental impact; demonstrating that integrating high efficiency e-cooking appliances as EPCs significantly increases initial investment but has minimal impact on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) while creating a stable demand anchor. This research also demonstrates that when capital expenses are covered through donations, and the system is and properly maintained, this solution enables Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) Tier 4 energy access, equivalent to Modern Energy Cooking Services (MECS). Comparative analyses of metrics such as leveraged cost of cooking a meal, global warming potential and MTF level confirm that an e-cooking solution combining EPC with optimized PVMG is economically and environmentally beneficial in this context compared to the baseline situation of cooking with traditional three-stone firewood stoves, with high scalability potential to other refugee camps in the context. Additional advantages include reduced deforestation and resource conflicts between refugees and host communities. Although findings may not be universally applicable, the decreasing costs of lithium-ion batteries and solar PV and the increasing reliability and quality of the solar PV technology, alongside rising biomass fuel prices, make electric cooking a cost-effective alternative, particularly in displacement settings. This study offers a valuable resource for energy practitioners and policymakers, supporting integrated e-cooking and electricity solutions.

Using a nationally representative survey (n = 1936), we analyze public support for six power generation technologies in Norway—wind power (onshore and offshore), solar power (building- and ground-mounted), hydropower, and nuclear power. We find strong support for solar power on buildings, hydropower, and nuclear power, while wind power, particularly onshore, faces considerable opposition. Perceived nature loss, visual disturbances and risk of accidents are consistently correlated with opposition, whereas perceived job creation and greater price stability drive support. When asked to indicate their preferred portfolio of new power generation capacity, we find that respondents favor hydropower and nuclear energy while preferring smaller shares for both wind and solar power. By incorporating these preferences into an energy system model, we find that aligning energy investments with public preferences significantly increases price variability and system costs. These findings highlight challenging trade-offs for policymakers and investors between energy supply, environmental concerns, and costs: The solutions favored by the public align with limiting nature loss, but also imply substantially increased system costs. Facilitating an informed dialogue and systematically internalizing negative externalities is crucial to ensure an energy system that has security of supply, is cost efficient and accepted by the public.}

abstract = {Background
Gamma oscillations play an important role in cognitive processes, including emotional processing in humans. Abnormal gamma oscillations may reflect certain psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). However, less attention has been paid to the role of gamma oscillations in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and their association with the response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).
Methods
A total of 61 TRD patients were recruited for a two-week rTMS treatment consisting of ten sessions. Clinical assessments and eyes-closed resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were conducted before and after treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: prolonged intermittent theta burst stimulation (piTBS), 10-Hz rTMS, or a Sham group. Adaptive nonlinear analysis using Holo–Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA) was applied to extract nonlinear information from the EEG data.
Results
Gamma oscillations were found to be positively correlated with scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17). Additionally, changes in alpha-beta amplitude modulation (AM) modulated gamma oscillations were significantly larger in the Sham group compared to the two active stimulation groups. Furthermore, alpha-beta AM modulated gamma activity was significantly lower in responders compared to non-responders prior to rTMS treatment, irrespective of the specific rTMS protocol.
Conclusions
Gamma oscillations may serve as an electrophysiological marker for the severity of depression in TRD. Additionally, alpha-beta AM could represent a potential predictor of response to rTMS treatment, identifiable prior to the treatment.

A crucial factor is adopting low-temperature distribution, known as 4th generation district heating (4GDH), which enhances efficiency and utilization of low-carbon heat sources. This paper presents a novel methodology combining 1) a DH company-level economic model implemented in General Algebraic Modeling System with 2) an energy system model based on Backbone modelling framework, for modelling energy transition in a DH system. This approach considers both the realistic economic constraints that a DH company would have while also providing an accurate, hourly-level perspective on how the system is operated. The approach is ideal for assessing realistic transition pathways to low-temperature distribution and supports decision-making in realizing the 4GDH systems. The methodology is presented as a demonstration case for a small DH system located in Kitee, Finland. The results showcase the key features of the modeling approaches, including the development of the market share and price of DH in different competition environments, and the investment path in the transition and its impact on the long-term finances of the DH company. The market share of low temperature district heat varied between 18 and 74 % among the modelled cases. The results demonstrate that different competition cases produce considerably different outcomes on how the DH system evolves and how low-temperature DH gains market share.}

This study aimed to characterize structural brain differences in children with MDD and euthymic BD using high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 51 children (aged 10–14 years) were categorized into MDD, euthymic BD, and typically developing (TD) controls. Utilizing advanced surface-based morphometry, we examined four cortical features: fractal dimension, gyrification, sulcal depth, and cortical thickness, to delineate disorder-specific and shared neuroanatomical alterations. Additionally, we explored the interaction between white matter volumetrics and these surface-based metrics to assess its modulatory role in structural brain differences. Our results revealed significant cortical alterations, with distinct and overlapping patterns in both MDD and BD. The findings demonstrated disruptions in cortical complexity, folding patterns, and sulcal morphology, particularly in regions implicated in emotion regulation and cognitive processing. These structural variations provide critical insights into the neurodevelopmental alterations associated with pediatric mood disorders. By integrating multiple morphometric parameters, this study offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the neuroanatomical changes in MDD and BD, contributing to more precise diagnostic biomarkers. The results underscore the importance of incorporating surface-based morphometry and white matter interactions in future research to refine early diagnosis and targeted interventions for mood disorders in children.}

abstract = {Germany’s predominantly rainfed agricultural sector faces growing challenges from climate change-induced drought and heat stress. To adapt, farmers may expand irrigation, exacerbating competition for water and depleting groundwater resources. Here, we project the future irrigation water demand for field crops under four integrated socioeconomic and climatic scenarios using a hybrid modeling approach. This combines a hydro-economic multi-agent system (MAS) model, scenario-based price projections from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and a machine learning crop yield model. The crop yield model is driven by meteorological data and soil moisture outputs from the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) along three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The MAS model, calibrated using Positive Mathematical Programming, simulates land use and irrigation decisions at the district level and is validated with land use data from 2000–2020. Our results underscore the critical role of socioeconomic factors in expanding irrigation. In the far future (2069–98), mean irrigation intensity increases by + 7 % and + 22 % across all scenarios, but total irrigation demand varies significantly: in SSP1-RCP2.6, it decreases by −38 %, while in SSP2-RCP4.5, it doubles. Under SSP5-RCP8.5, demand increases by + 6 %, whereas in SSP3-RCP8.5, it rises 8.1-fold. Nevertheless, high uncertainty from crop price projections significantly influences these results. Spatial heterogeneity strongly shapes adaptation, with farmers adjusting their land use in response to declining rainfed crop yields. This study underscores the importance of integrating multi-agent, process-based, and machine learning models to enhance irrigation demand projections and support proactive water resource management under climate and socioeconomic change.}

The scale of the transition necessitates an understanding of how different implementation levels of different emission policies impact national energy systems and decarbonization targets. We utilize the open-source, sector-coupled energy system optimization model Balmorel to analyze detailed European pathways and the impact of three decarbonization scenarios. We consider (1) a European-level carbon budget, (2) a carbon budget broken down to national levels, and (3) a carbon tax policy. The novelty of this paper lies in how these policies affect the European decarbonization pathway in the short term and long term and how they can affect interactions between countries and national emission- and renewable targets. We demonstrate that the final production mix in 2050 remains near-identical across scenarios, with some variation in biomass sequestration, but differences occur between countries in intermediary years. A European budget causes mismatches between the considered budget and modeled emissions in several countries with more fossil capacity, which can be mitigated by both the country-level budget and a carbon tax. Still, country-level budgets lead to emission displacement, and a carbon tax is significantly more investment-intensive.}

Accurate renewable energy resource assessments are necessary for energy system planning to meet climate goals, yet inconsistencies in methods and data can produce significant differences in results. This paper introduces ETHOS.REFLOW, a Python-based workflow manager that ensures transparency and reproducibility in energy potential assessments. The tool enables reproducible analyses with minimal effort by automating the entire workflow, from data acquisition to reporting. We demonstrate its functionality by estimating the technical offshore wind potential of the North Sea, for fixed-foundation and mixed-technology (including floating turbines) scenarios. Two methods for turbine siting (explicit placement vs. uniform power density) and wind datasets are compared. Results show a maximum installable capacity of 768–861 GW and an annual yield of 2,961–3,047 TWh, with capacity factors between 41% and 46% and significant temporal variability. ETHOS.REFLOW offers a robust framework for reproducible energy potential studies, enabling energy system modelers to build on existing work and fostering trust in findings.}

The integrated setup was simulated in TRNSYS, coupled with a validated MATLAB model of the DCMD module. An innovative dynamic co-simulation approach was developed, combining TRNSYS for the solar thermal subsystem and MATLAB for detailed DCMD calculations. The MATLAB model is based on fundamental heat and mass transfer equations in both counter-current and co-current configurations. The system’s annual transient performance was analyzed under typical weather conditions in Ain Temouchent, Algeria. Results showed that the DCMD system can produce approximately 100 liters of distilled water per day, with performance highly dependent on solar collector area and feed water temperature (50–70°). Key findings include an annual yield of 36 m3 with 5 h of daily operation, solar fraction up to 97% for 6 m2 of collectors, and membrane performance ratios between 1.78–1.93.

In a case study, we explore the role of thermal generation availability and cross-regional exchanges in core European countries during the winter of 2022/2023. We assess generation adequacy under both typical stochastic variations and specific stress scenarios, such as reduced nuclear availability in France and restricted Russian gas supplies. Thereby, we derive assessments of expected energy not served (EENS) and loss of load expectation (LOLE) based on high-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that generation adequacy was at risk in several core European countries based on the data available at the end of September 2022. Yet, the European interconnected power grid contributed to a substantial risk reduction.}

Using a building database and statistical data, we analyzed how much of the residential heat demand in Germany could be independently met by homeowners using PV, heat pumps, batteries, and thermal energy storage. Our energy system model, based on detailed bottom-up building simulations, indicates that 35.2 % of the average annual heat demand can be covered by on-site supply. Grid savings are most significant in well-refurbished single-family and terraced houses, reaching 35 % annually. During cold periods, these houses achieve grid savings of 52%–70%, while in warm periods, they feed 155%–317% surplus electricity back into the grid. Understanding the electricity consumption and grid contributions of solar-assisted heat pumps is critical for accurate grid load forecasting and planning local grid expansions.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) presents significant public health challenges due to its increasing prevalence and complex risk factors. This study systematically analyzed data from 2019 to 2023 to explore trends in MDD incidence, symptom progression, and multidimensional influencing factors.
Objective
The study aimed to identify key risk factors and mechanisms of MDD progression through multidimensional variable analysis and machine learning model evaluation, optimizing predictive models to provide a scientific basis for early screening, targeted interventions, and public health policy formulation.
Methods
Data from the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were analyzed using LASSO regression for feature selection and various machine learning models (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Gaussian NB, Extra Trees) for risk prediction. SHAP value analysis was employed to interpret the models and identify key predictors across psychological, social, and biological domains.
Results
Depression risk was closely associated with psychological health (e.g., PHQ82, ANXLEVEL), social support (e.g., DISCRIM1, PCNTADLT), and biological health (e.g., COGMEMDFF, DEPEV). AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Gaussian NB, and Extra Trees demonstrated superior performance in different tasks, with SHAP analysis highlighting the critical role of psychological health in risk prediction and the importance of social support and cognitive deficits in symptom progression.
Conclusions
This study provides a scientific foundation for early screening of MDD, personalized intervention strategies, and public health policy optimization. Future research should expand data coverage, optimize models, and incorporate causal inference methods to enhance the precision and applicability of depression risk prediction.}

Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is considered when an individual fails to respond to two or more different antidepressants in adequate doses, duration and with adequate adherence within the same major depressive episode.
Aim
To examine the clinical profiles of TRD patients through data from electronic healthcare records and compare characteristics and treatment pathways of ethnic minority and non-minority patients in UK.
Methods
A retrospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study of patients with TRD was carried out in 10 Mental Health NHS Foundation Trusts in the Akrivia Health/UK Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system network. The CRIS system was used as a means of analysing de-identified data across 3.2 million anonymised patients' records.
Results
10,048 patient records were deemed eligible for this study, of which 20.2 % of patients identified as BAME, and 79.8 % patients identified as White. Overall, around half of the patients were likely to be prescribed an antidepressant within 2 months of the MDD diagnosis. White patients were prescribed more antidepressants than the BAME group (p < 0.001), with a significant effect size for comorbidities.
Limitations
The nature of the data source limited the ability to filter for short treatment durations as clinicians did not often record concrete medication end-dates in clinical note fields.
Conclusion
There are significant differences in care pathways between ethnic groups in relation to TRD patients. It is vital to understand factors causing these potential clinical biases and increase awareness and education to deliver the most effective treatments for TRD in ethnic minority patients.}

abstract = {A crucial challenge in tensegrity design is form-finding, which is to determine a self-equilibrated geometric configuration that satisfies tensegrity attributes. In this regard, traditional gradient/Hessian-based methods often get trapped in saddle points or local minima, making them unsuitable for complex tensegrities. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while effective at global optimization, can be computationally expensive. Conventional two-step form-finding approaches first use singular value decomposition (SVD) to extract independent self-stress states to further determine the global tensegrity configuration. However, for multi-cell tensegrities, the increased number of members and shared components lead to coupled self-stress states, rendering SVD-based approaches impractical and necessitating an alternative optimization-driven approach. To address these limitations of existing approaches, this study proposes a hybrid form-finding method combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) with modified Differential Evolution (mDE). By integrating GA’s global search with DE’s advanced mutation and self-adaptive crossover, the approach enhances efficiency while reducing computational costs. Unlike conventional methods, it eliminates the need for SVD and bypasses the iterative selection of self-stress states, inherently ensuring stability constraints and applicability for multi-cell tensegrities. The methodology is validated on various tensegrity configurations, demonstrating its ability to efficiently generate stable, self-equilibrated structures. This novel approach is perceived to offer a scalable and computationally viable solution for tensegrity design, overcoming key limitations of existing methods.}

abstract = {Future renewable energy systems are expected to heavily rely on low-emission hydrogen, not least as a crucial feedstock for industry. Although there are numerous pan-European system studies exploring a cost-efficient hydrogen ramp-up, a number of issues are driving companies to develop site-specific transformation strategies, that are not always in line with the results of these large-scale studies. Addressing this gap, this study contributes a detailed analysis of a real-world chemical site in Southern Germany that depends on hydrogen as a feedstock. In doing so, insights in industry transformation options and its implications at site level are provided. Applying a cost-optimizing energy system model, several corporate strategies and extensive sensitivity analyses for the transition to renewable hydrogen are evaluated for the period 2025 to 2045. This involves considering on-site interdependencies between the production and use of hydrogen as a feedstock and the site's electricity and heat sector. The results show that under a purely rational strategy and current expectations, the transformation to renewable hydrogen will not become competitive before 2045, while neither expensive emission allowances, nor low-priced hydrogen supply on their own will result in a substantially accelerated transformation. This highlights the need for additional policy measures. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that under almost any realistic condition within the following 20 years, using hydrogen for heat generation below 200 °C is unlikely. Therefore, prioritizing the electrification of process heat supply while waiting for hydrogen imports would be a logical approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.}

This study sheds light on the potential implications of expanding the consumption of venison from hunted wild deer through deer population management efforts. It focuses on changes in environmental impacts resulting from changes in the demand for livestock meat due to increased consumption of wild venison. We analyzed the demand system between them using the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model and scanner data from a grocery store chain in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. The results show that wild venison is a substitute good for pork and lamb. By contrast, wild venison is a complementary good for imported and domestic beef. Based on the estimated demand system model, we conducted an environmental footprint analysis to estimate the changes in environmental impacts when venison consumption increased. This shows that the greenhouse gas, water, and land footprints would increase, indicating greater environmental impacts, under a scenario of expanded venison consumption. The results demonstrate that increased venison consumption does not necessarily reduce the net environmental impacts of meat consumption, which depends on the demand system for meat products and the environmental footprint intensities of the respective products.}

abstract = {Background
Music can directly influence emotions, the regulation of which are known to be impaired in major depressive disorder (MDD). While music therapy (MT) could be an effective complement to treat MDD, studies investigating such effects have not yet yielded conclusive results. We hypothesized that group music therapy (GMT) might lead to a significant reduction of depressive symptoms (DS).
Methods
In a randomized controlled trial, 102 women with current MDD were randomly assigned to an intervention group receiving GMT or a waitlist control group. Data assessment was conducted pre- (T0), post- (T1), and at a 10-week follow-up to (T2) the intervention. DS as the primary outcome were assessed via observer-rated (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, T0–T1), self-rated (Beck Depression Inventory, T0–T1–T2), and ecological momentary (T0–T1) assessments. Secondary effects on emotion and mood regulation strategies, and quality of life (QoL), were measured T0–T1–T2.
Results
The results suggest non-significant effects of the GMT on a descriptive level on self-reported and observer rated DS and statistically significant effects on DS in everyday life, QoL, and regulation strategies, with larger effects from T0–T1 than from T0–T1–T2.
Limitations
The generalizability is limited by the high dropout rate and data loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the fact that long-term effects of GMT are not assured, and the homogeneous gender (female) of the sample.
Conclusions
GMT is an economical approach to treat MDD, yielding health-promoting effects regarding DS, emotion regulation, and QoL. Manualization and further evaluation of MT is strongly recommended.}

Using a myopic power system model, we assess the role of pyrolysis, which operates solely on residual biomass. By 2050, pyrolysis can reach an installed capacity of 5 GW, supplying 2 % of total electricity generation. Its flexible power output reduces the need for hydrogen storage by 60 %, as it generates electricity during low renewable supply periods and offsets CO2 emissions from gas-fired power plants through biochar sequestration. This enables continued gas plant operation without new investments while maintaining a net-negative CO2 balance. Pyrolysis deployment is closely linked to solar PV availability, expanding earlier in high-solar regions, and its integration increases battery storage capacity by 240 %. The expansion of pyrolysis is driven by investment costs (CAPEX) and electricity demand, with lower CAPEX—below 308 €/(tBM/year) for pyrolysis plants and 2,300 €/kWel for power generation units—accelerating deployment. Rising electricity demand enhances pyrolysis’ role as a flexible power source, even under high CAPEX conditions. These findings highlight pyrolysis as a strategic enabler of energy system decarbonization, uniquely combining dispatchable renewable electricity and negative emissions. Its integration underscores the need for a diversified power plant portfolio to maintain system flexibility and stability, providing essential insights for policymakers, investors, and energy planners on optimizing market frameworks and deployment strategies.}

abstract = {Background
While theta burst stimulation (TBS) shows promise in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), its effectiveness in bipolar depression (BD-D) remains uncertain. Optimizing treatment parameters is crucial in the pursuit of rapid symptom relief. Moreover, aligning with personalized treatment strategies and increased interest in immunopsychiatry, biomarker-based stratification of patients most likely to benefit from TBS might improve remission rates. We investigated treatment effectiveness of continuous TBS (cTBS) compared to sham in BD-D, and assessed the capacity of plasma kynurenine pathway metabolites to predict treatment outcome.
Methods
Thirty-seven patients with BD-D underwent accelerated active or sham cTBS treatment in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Depressive symptoms were measured with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) before treatment (T0), 3–4 days posttreatment (T1) and 10–11 days posttreatment (T2). Plasma tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid concentrations were quantified with ELISA. Linear mixed models were used for statistical analyses.
Results
Although the total sample showed depressive symptom improvement, active cTBS did not demonstrate greater symptom alleviation compared to sham. However, higher baseline quinolinic acid significantly predicted symptom improvement in the active treatment group, not in sham-stimulated patients.
Limitations
The modest sample size limited the power to detect significant differences with regard to treatment effect. Also, the follow-up period was 10–11 days, whereas similar studies usually follow up for at least one month.
Conclusion
More research is required to optimize cTBS for BD-D and explore the involvement of quinolinic acid in treatment outcome.}

The aim is to determine the economic feasibility and broader energy system benefits of utilising excess heat generated at key stages of the PtM process, including electrolysis, methanol synthesis, and carbon capture. The study develops and evaluates nine main scenarios, along with numerous sub-scenarios, which compare different PtM facility configurations and placements. Specifically, it contrasts the benefits of siting these facilities near renewable energy sources versus closer to district heating systems. By examining these placement strategies, the study provides a detailed analysis of the trade-offs involved in maximising PtM market viability and minimising costs and fuel consumption in the DH systems. It is found that incorporating EH from PtM into DH can lead to reductions in both the operational costs (up to 18 %) and the primary energy consumption (up to 23 %) of the DH supply by displacing fossil fuel and biomass use. Additionally, the sale of excess heat can reduce the levelized cost of energy for PtM up to 10 % under optimal conditions. Importantly, the research demonstrates that strategic placement and effective policy incentives, such as grid tariff exemptions, are critical to enhancing the financial viability of PtM.}

Shade is one of the most practical methods to mitigate heat stress in feedlot cattle. An experiment was conducted as a completely randomized design with 1 560 Bos indicus bulls (initial BW=287 kg) where three shade structure types were used to investigate the effects of different heat stress mitigation methods on cattle growth performance, environmental, and economic outcomes using live animal data, and a partial lifecycle assessment using the Integrated Farm System Model. The live animal portion of the experiment was done once a year over a 2-year period with three pen replications per treatment per year (n = 6 per treatment). Four shade structures used were conventional shade (SC; steel shade 1.8 m2 of shade/animal), double conventional shade (DS; steel shade 3.6 m2 of shade/animal), dome structures without fans (DSA; 8.5 m2/animal with 98% solar radiation blocked), and domes with fans (DCA; DSA plus three large sized low-speed fans). Each pen held 65 bulls in an area of 570 m2. Live animal data were analyzed as a completely randomized design using the GLM procedure of SAS (version 9.4) with shade type as fixed effect, pen as the experimental unit, and repetition (year) considered a random effect. Cattle housed under DCA had 22 and 20 kg heavier final body BW (P < 0.05) compared to those housed under SC and DS, respectively. Final BW of DCA and DSA cattle were similar (P > 0.05). Average daily gain, feed efficiency, and hot carcass weight were greater (P < 0.05) for cattle housed under DCA compared to the rest of the shade types. Dry matter intake was not affected (P > 0.05). When treatment results were extrapolated to the annual feedlot turnover of 209,700 animals, cattle in DSA and DCA versus SC and DS had 3–8% reductions in greenhouse gas and ammonia emission intensities. Compared to SC, DCA increased profitability by $29.66/animal, followed by DSA and DS with profit increases of $5.79 and $8.90/animal, respectively. Overall, the implementation of advanced shade structures improved cattle performance and profitability while reducing the environmental impact of beef production.}

In this study, we present the design, implementation, and validation of an innovative experimental setup aimed at researching and evaluating the controllability of such a biofeedback system. Our setup incorporates a novel low-complexity model, considering the brain, natural lenses (e.g., the crystalline lens), and electrically tunable lenses, to establish a fundamental model for hybrid biofeedback systems. This model is developed based on an analysis of biofeedback systems, geometrical optics, and control theory, facilitating the identification of strategies to decouple system dynamics and enable precise controllability analysis. The proposed experimental setup was validated with volunteers, providing evidence that confirms the reliable operation of the biofeedback system. Our approach encourages a shift from conventional qualitative approaches toward quantitative evaluation of biofeedback devices. The proposed model and experimental setup hold the potential to statistically assess the controllability of hybrid biofeedback systems for correcting presbyopia, paving the way for further advancements in this field.}

We found iPSC line-dependent differences in antiviral toxicity. We observed that antiviral treatment restored NPCs and RNOs gene expression after CMV infection and reduced CMV copy numbers. Infection of NPCs and RNOs with the clinical CMV strain, but not with the lab-adapted strain, led to an impaired expression of cortical development markers. Our findings highlight the value of using physiologically relevant human models and clinical CMV strains to understand the neuropathogenesis of congenital CMV and to test therapeutic strategies.}

The building stock, including electric vehicles, can offer flexibility, but it is still unclear towards which objective the flexibility should be provided. Further, it is complicated for end-users to react to market prices. This paper investigates how buildings adapt their electricity use by following pre-defined tactics, known as heuristics, instead of market prices. Two heuristics are studied in two future scenarios compliant with European renovation policies. Based on the responses towards the heuristics, this study explores how flexibility from the Norwegian building stock impact electricity production and cross-border exchanges towards 2040. Results show that hourly electricity delivery to the building stock can be strongly modified, resulting in decreased peak electricity delivery by 10%–12% in 2040 when following the heuristics. Nevertheless, findings suggest limited impact on the strategic investments in the power market as flexible Norwegian hydropower adapts production patterns towards economic and operational stability in response to the demand-side load modifications. Further research should continue exploring local impacts of flexibility heuristics, including grid bottlenecks and on-site electricity production integration, and refine assumptions about hydropower flexibility in aggregated power system models.}

While use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data appears promising in this vein, the contribution and transferability of various features (e.g. vegetation indices, plant height and texture features) in crop above ground biomass (AGB) prediction remain poorly understood. Here, our objectives were to (1) evaluate the performance of various machine learning (ML) algorithms in the synthesis of multiple features, (2) elicit the contribution of various UAV features, (3) assess the transferability of features across growth stages and sites. Four field experiments, incorporating several water and nitrogen treatments across two sites, were assembled for use in AGB prognostics. We invoked four ML algorithms—Random forest (RF), Lasso regression (LR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and a stacked ensemble integrating the three methods (SML)—to predict wheat AGB using multiple UAV data and phenological information. Additionally, interpretable ML techniques were employed to elucidate the influence of UAV features on AGB prediction across growth stages. Our results showed that all algorithms exhibited robust performance in predicting wheat biomass, with RMSE values of 1.64, 1.71, 1.71, and 1.57 Mg ha−1 for RF, LR, KNN, and SML, respectively. RF predominantly relied on plant height features, LR leveraged vegetation indices, and KNN prioritized texture features, while SML synthesized the advantages of multiple ML algorithms. Fusion of multiple datasets amplified model prognostic capacity and scalability, with R2 and rRMSE of 0.92 and 22 % when using data from external sites. Features pertaining to vegetation indices and plant height during vegetative growth and around flowering had seminal contributions of model predictions. Texture features significantly reduced the saturation effect during the reproductive stage but diminished the model’s transferability during the vegetative stage. Complementarity among data types enhanced effectiveness of ensemble machine learning, which leverages strengths of diverse data to improve the accuracy and robustness of AGB predictions. Future studies could combine multiple sources of remote sensing, such as LiDAR and thermal infrared alongside system modeling, to improve ML accuracy and generalization capability.}

Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) have shown alterations of processes underlying response inhibition, which is the cognitive process that permits the suppression of habitual or natural behavioural responses to stimuli to select a more appropriate response that is coherent with the goal; these alterations have been correlated with cognitive deficits, especially in older adults. Electrophysiological (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have investigated the neuronal and hemodynamic process underlying inhibition through tasks measuring the ability to suppress a dominant response when non-target stimuli are shown and reported differences between healthy controls (HCs) and MDD subjects. However, these were unimodal studies that provided an incomplete picture of the phenomenon, due to the single technique sensitivity and limited by the characteristics of each technique itself. In this study, we performed an EEG-driven fMRI analysis to explore the different hemodynamic correlates of specific event-related potentials (ERPs) of inhibitory control in late-onset MDD during a visuomotor Go/No-Go task. The dataset was composed of 18 older adult HCs and 18 late-onset MDD patients. Behavioral analysis showed higher response time to target stimuli in inhibitory blocks and lower percentage of correct answers for target stimuli in MDD compared to HCs. ERP analysis revealed the inhibitory effect for both N2 and P3 in both groups. Moreover, EEG-driven fMRI analysis showed alterations in the MDD group in the superior temporal gyrus and cerebellar areas for N2 correlates, whereas in the supramarginal, left rolandic, and Heschl’s areas for P3 correlates. The study showed the potentiality of the EEG-fMRI integration for investigating complex cognitive processes. Specifically, the EEG-driven fMRI analyses showed different correlates for separate cognitive processing steps, N2 and P3, highlighting differences between MDD and HC.}

Selection cutting, a key method within CCF, presents unique challenges for forest growth modelling due to its complex structure and distinct growth dynamics. Current models, largely developed from data obtained from even-aged stands, may exhibit lower accuracy when applied to uneven-aged stands. This study assessed the short-term (i.e., up to 15 years) predictive accuracy of the Swedish Heureka Decision Support System for stands managed with selection cutting. It assessed growth models for tree recruitment, growth, and mortality using data from 27 CCF field experiments covering a broad latitudinal and environmental range across Sweden. A linear mixed-effects modelling approach was used to analyse differences between observations and model predictions. Findings revealed potential species-specific biases, with an average underestimation of volume growth by 2 m³ ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ after ten years of simulation, driven predominantly by underestimations in Norway spruce growth. While mortality predictions were generally accurate, they exhibited slight underestimation after recent cutting and overestimation otherwise. Ingrowth density predictions demonstrated minor biases, with spruce being underestimated and birch overestimated, but displayed high residual variability. Sensitivity analysis revealed correlations of residuals with stand variables, including site index, proportion of spruce, and stand basal area. The study faced limitations due to data scarcity and the short observation periods. Although most observed biases were not statistically significant, the findings underscore potential discrepancies when applying current Swedish models to selection cutting stands.}

abstract = {Background
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and its abbreviated versions, the PHQ-8 and the PHQ-2, are frequently used as online depression screeners. Their accuracy to detect major depressive disorder (MDD) has been examined in only a limited number of studies in student samples.
Objective
Assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of PHQ-9, PHQ-8 and PHQ-2 to detect MDD.
Methods
A general online population sample was recruited through traditional and social media campaigns, print advertisement in public areas of several German cities and via a nationwide online access survey panel. Participants, aged 18 years or above, completed the PHQ-9 online and were assessed for MDD via telephone using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values, and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated in a cross-sectional design to assess diagnostic accuracy.
Results
In total, n = 790 participants (574 (72.7 %) female, age: 37.4 (SD = 13.9; range: 18–79)) were screened with the PHQ-9 (mean = 11.1; SD = 5.4) and interviewed via telephone using the SCID (41.2 % fulfilling the criterion of MDD). The optimal cut-off was 11 points for the PHQ-9 (sensitivity: 0.77; specificity: 0.68; AUC: 0.80; NPV: 0.81; PPV: 0.63), 11 points for the PHQ-8 (sensitivity: 0.74; specificity: 0.71; AUC: 0.79; NPV: 0.79; PPV: 0.64) and 3 points for the PHQ-2 (sensitivity: 0.68; specificity: 0.74; AUC: 0.76; NPV: 0.77; PPV: 0.65). Descriptively, age or gender had limited impact on diagnostic accuracy.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the online version of the PHQ-9, PHQ-8, and PHQ-2 show moderate to good diagnostic accuracy to detect MDD. Still, screening results should be interpreted with caution as a number of cases are likely to be either missed or incorrectly identified.}

To maintain synchronization between models and code/documents — which can evolve independently — this paper introduces BIT, a bidirectional language that can serve as a conventional template language for model-to-text transformations. However, a BIT program can function as both a printer, generating text by filling template holes with values from the input model, and a parser, putting parsed values back into the model. BIT comprises a surface language for better usability and a core language for formal definition. We define the semantics of the core language based on the theory of bidirectional transformation, and provide the translation from the surface to the core. We present the proof sketch of the well behavedness of BIT as a formal evidence of soundness. We also conduct three case studies to empirically demonstrate the expressiveness and the effectiveness of BIT. Based on the proof and the case studies, BIT covers the major features of existing template languages, and offers sufficient expressiveness to define real-world model-to-text transformations that can be executed bidirectionally and incrementally.}

abstract = {Kalman filters are widely used for real-time sensor data processing in mechatronic and production systems, but their effectiveness depends on accurate system models. These models also need updating in order to handle changing or unknown operating conditions. Data-driven methods excel in adapting models to match measurements without heavy reliance on expert knowledge, but they suffer from drawbacks such as reduced interpretability, limited extrapolatability, and poor reliability for long-term predictions. Hybrid methods that integrate traditional and data-driven modeling aim to combine the strengths of both approaches, yet achieving accurate convergence between the distinct physical and data-driven components remains a significant challenge during joint optimization. This paper introduces a novel methodology based on three key ideas. First, a dual extended Kalman filter is used to jointly estimate and adapt model parameters in real-time. Second, a hybrid model combining physics-based and data-driven parameters is embedded in the filter, resulting in a more generalizable and accurate model. Finally, an extension to ensembling techniques is proposed to improve convergence toward correct physical parameters. The proposed ensemble of hybrid dual extended Kalman filters is evaluated on a cam follower system working under a wide range of operating conditions. Results demonstrate its ability to learn both the cam shape and operating voltage during operation and converged models show a reduced error in physical parameter estimates of more than 60% compared to alternative filtering techniques. Moreover, these models outperform other methods in multi-step prediction, showcasing an improvement of more than 48% in prediction accuracy. With this work, we aim to demonstrate the efficacy of physics-informed models in a filtering context and address the challenge of correct parameter learning despite the overparameterization inherent in these models.}

Population-based surveys suggest that low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with higher prevalence of depressive symptoms, while their healthcare utilization is not necessarily higher.
Objective
To investigate the association between neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES) and healthcare utilization among individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD).
Method
This was a retrospective longitudinal study of all adults with a first MDD diagnosis within primary care during 2010–2018. NSES was defined by the household area of residence using the Mosaic™ classification. Outcomes were AD (antidepressants) (N06A) dispensation and psychiatric outpatient visit, both of which are outlined as options in depression guidelines. Cox multivariable regression was used for the time to event analyses.
Results
A total of 117,193 individuals were included, of which 87,499 (75 %) were dispensed an AD and 35,989 (31 %) had a recorded psychiatric outpatient visit. Low NSES was associated with lower rate of AD dispensation in the first-year post-diagnosis (HR: 0.95, 95 % CI: 0.93–0.96, p < 0.001) and higher rate of psychiatric visit (HR: 1.10, 95 % CI: 1.07–1.12, p < 0.001) compared with high NSES.
Limitations
Data sources have high coverage. A minority of psychiatric care provided by non-publicly financed providers was not included. It was not possible to adjust for depression severity.
Conclusion
Socioeconomic status as measured by the neighborhood of residency was associated with AD dispensation and psychiatric outpatient visit in MDD, also in a healthcare system with virtually free access. This is of relevance for clinical practice, considering the focus on equity of care and the increase in depression prevalence worldwide.}

Major depressive disorder (MDD) comes along with an increased risk of recurrence and poor course of illness. Machine learning has recently shown promise in the prediction of mental illness, yet models aiming to predict MDD course are still rare and do not quantify the predictive value of established MDD recurrence risk factors.
Methods
We analyzed N = 571 MDD patients from the Marburg-Münster Affective Disorder Cohort Study (MACS). Using random forest classifiers, we predicted i) recurrence of depressive episodes and ii) MDD disease trajectories, within a 2-year interval. Trajectories were identified through latent profile analysis, using a discovery and an internal validation sample. Three distinct models were implemented for predictions: two incorporating only literature-derived MDD recurrence risk factors, and a third incorporating a broader set of explorative features.
Results
Basing predictions on only seven recurrence risk factors, MDD recurrence could be predicted with a balanced accuracy (BACC) of 62.83 % and MDD trajectories were predicted with highest performance achieved for a remitted (BACC = 64.23 %) and a severe MDD trajectory (BACC = 63.17 %). Risk factors included childhood maltreatment, previous depressive episodes, residual symptoms, comorbid anxiety, age of onset, depression severity, and neuroticism. Including a broader feature set only yielded in minor increase of predictive performance.
Limitations
Lacking external validation, generalizability to other samples remains uncertain.
Conclusions
MDD recurrence and disease trajectories can be predicted based on literature-derived recurrence risk factors. Model performance must increase to be of use in clinical practice which could be achieved by including multimodal risk factors.}

Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and somatic symptom disorder (SSD) are associated with quality of life (QoL) reduction. This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between these conditions as categorical diagnoses and related psychopathologies with QoL, recognizing their frequent overlap.
Methods
We recruited a total of 403 clinical patients and healthy individuals, administering diagnostic interviews based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. QoL and psychopathologies were assessed using the WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) and several self-administered questionnaires, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses examined the associations between psychiatric diagnoses, psychopathologies, and QoL.
Results
SSD and MDD were independently associated with impaired global (β = −0.318 and − 0.287) and all QoL domains (β = −0.307, −0.150, −0.125, and − 0.133, in physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains respectively for SSD; β = −0.278, −0.344, −0.275, and − 0.268 for MDD).

The Patient Health Questionnaire-15 and Health Anxiety Questionnaire scores were associated with global (β = −0.168 and − 0.181) and physical (β = −0.293 and − 0.121) QoL domain, while the Cognitions About Body and Health Questionnaire score was only associated with environmental QoL domain (β = −0.157).
Conclusion
SSD and MDD were independently associated with QoL impairment. Depressive symptoms were associated with all QoL domains, whereas somatic symptom burden and health anxiety primarily affected the physical QoL domain. Clinicians should consider concomitant psychopathologies when managing patients with depression, anxiety, or somatic symptoms.}

The integration of IoT networks with the metaverse will enable more meaningful connections between the 'real' and 'virtual' worlds, allowing for real-time data analysis, access, and processing. However, these metaverse-IoT networks will face numerous security and privacy threats. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) offer an effective means of early detection for such attacks. Nevertheless, the metaverse generates substantial volumes of data due to its interactive nature and the multitude of user interactions within virtual environments, posing a computational challenge for building an intrusion detection system. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an innovative intrusion detection system model based on deep learning. This model aims to detect most attacks targeting metaverse-IoT communications and combines two techniques: KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis which was used for attack feature extraction and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks for attack recognition and classification. The efficiency of this proposed IDS model is assessed using two widely recognized benchmark datasets, BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT, which contain various IoT attacks potentially targeting IoT communications. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed IDS model in identifying 12 classes of attacks relevant to metaverse-IoT, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.8% and a False Negative Rate FNR less than 0.2. Furthermore, when compared with other models in the literature, our IDS model demonstrates superior performance in attack detection accuracy.}

A nonlinear mathematical model is established to describe the strategy decision-making process of the participants in this scenario. Subsequently, the strategy selection interaction relationship, strategy evolution stability, and dynamic decision-making process of the game players are investigated and verified by simulation experiments. The results show that maneuver-related parameters and random environmental interference factors have different effects on the selection and evolutionary speed of the agent’s strategies. Especially in a highly uncertain environment, even small information asymmetry or miscalculation may have a significant impact on decision-making. This also confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of the method proposed in the paper, which can better explain the behavioral decision-making process of the agent in the interaction process.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the common depressive disorder. MDD has high comorbidity and has greater implications on quality of life. Whole system Ayurveda management protocol (WSAP) is explored for it's possible role in management of MDD.
Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of Whole system Ayurveda management protocol on Major Depressive Disorder.
Material and Methods
Study was a randomized controlled trial. Total 50 patients of MDD meeting the DSM V criteria, age group 20–70 years of either sex participated in the study. They were randomly divided into two groups, control group received Escitalopram 10 mg twice a day and Ayurveda group was on WSAP. Interventions were for 60 days. Assessments were done through various clinical parameters like Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), WHO Quality of Life- BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), Clinical Global Improvement scale (CGI), UKU Side effect scale. Assessments during intervention was on every 15th day.
Results
Study showed that Ayurveda group produced significant outcome improvement compared to control group in HDRS (p = 0.01), HARS (p = 0.03), PSQI (p = 0.03), WHOQOL-Bref (p < 0.001) and UKU side effect scale (p = 0.02). Both the group showed improvements in all the parameters except in WHOQOL-Bref where Ayurveda group only showed improvements (p < 0.001). Effect size showed large effect in WHOQOL-Bref. Mild side effects were reported in control group and none in Ayurveda group.

Existing studies on net-zero scenarios using Energy System Optimization Models (ESOM) often overlook non-monetary aspects of consumers' mobility choices but primarily focus on cost aspects. This study incorporates consumers' travel time duration and valuation, and an endogenous modal shift option into the Swiss TIMES Energy system Model (STEM). STEM is applied in a multi-objective optimization framework to quantify the impacts of faster Public Transport (PT) and slower car speeds on modal shifts in the transport sector's transformation. Similarly, we assess scenarios where consumers weigh travel time less, reflecting improved travel productivity. The results show that speed variations on medium- and long-distance trips, which can be interpreted as policies for highway speed limits and more efficient PT, can induce modal shifts towards 5–10% higher PT demand. Its implied secondary effects across the energy system include a reduced need for electrification of heavy-duty trucks by 11% and a decrease in hydrogen demand in road transportation by 34% by 2050. If travelers weigh costs over travel time, PT becomes less competitive against cars. Thus, electric vehicles (EVs) need to play a more dominant role in decarbonization, with a demand increase of 13% in 2040 (+9.2 billion passenger kilometer (bpkm)) and 6% in 2050 (+5.0 bpkm), along with the need for additional 45,000 public chargers of 22 kW size. Policy implications include the emphasis on improved PT speeds, speed limits on highways, needs to achieve more widespread EV adoption, and the need for balancing travelers' decision factors when aiming for reduced transport CO2 emissions.}

For this purpose, we show the connection between the functioning principle of the tool and processes occurring in the human mind including a description of its structure as perceived by an external observer. This is followed by an overview of selected fragments of fuzzy propositional logic, the theory of fuzzy sets, and the conclusions derived from it. The main part consists of formulating an algebraic description of the computational process of multi-criteria evaluation of the considered alternative performed by a fuzzy system, which serves as the executive unit of a Fuzzy calculator. This is supplemented by a flowchart diagram illustrating the algorithm of its functioning. The Fuzzy calculator distinguishes itself from other fuzzy systems by standardizing all linguistic variables, regardless of the number of linguistic values, into a unified framework comprising three terms L, M, and H, which are represented using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, ensuring precise mathematical characterization. During the transformation, the original linguistic terms are preserved by incorporating the positions of their support intervals, thereby maintaining the specificity of the input information. This approach establishes the Fuzzy calculator as a universal and highly adaptable tool, capable of addressing a wide range of practical managerial problems with improved consistency and control.}

abstract = {Ammonia is a promising carbon-free fuel for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, direct feeding of ammonia into the SOFC may lead to serious degradation due to the nitriding. Conversely, the pre-cracking of ammonia introduces complexity to the system design and causes increased power losses in the system. Therefore, it is crucial to explore all these aspects simultaneously. In this context, this study introduces a novel multiscale modeling approach by integrating a 3D multiphysics simulation of the ammonia-fueled SOFC stack with system-level modeling to investigate the reliability and performance of the stack and system. Two different cell technologies developed for low temperature (LT) and high temperature (HT) operation are investigated at LT (600 – 700°C) and HT (700 – 800°C) ranges. The results indicate that fuel inlet temperature should be 55°C and 18°C higher than the minimum temperature in 0% pre-cracking case for HT and LT cases, respectively. The increase in the required air flow rate for cooling in the 100% pre-cracking case compared to the 0% pre-cracking case is around 100% and 216% for the HT and LT cases, respectively. However, stack power production and power losses in the system components are comparable for LT and HT cases which leads to similar system performance. A larger share of the active area is affected by nitriding in LT cases than HT ones. However, a smaller cracking ratio at LT (∼ 82%) compared to HT conditions (∼ 92%) is needed for elimination of nitriding. While the LT and HT cases are comparable in terms of system power production, the lower stack outlet temperatures in LT cases require novel and more expensive catalysts for ammonia pre-cracking and HT cases need more expensive steels.}

A 1-MW facility with a Rankine transcritical CO2 cycle providing combined heat and power for a small industrial facility in Texas was proposed as the baseline power plant to perform the analysis. A design and modeling effort was performed in Engineering Equation Solver (EES) for the many systems and components of the power plant, including the solar field, the power block, and sub-components such as turbomachinery and heat exchangers. The model created enabled the simulation of plant performance for the median day of each month in the year by inputting meteorological TMY3 data, and results were extrapolated to estimate the annual energy and monetary income yield. Data processing was performed with MATLAB. Economic analysis included estimation of capital and O&M costs for the baseline plant. Results were verified through empirical performance simulation, using System Advisor Model (SAM), a software provided by NREL. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for the modeled plant was $0.2915/kWh, as calculated with EES/MATLAB, and $0.305/kWh, as calculated with SAM, resulting in a difference of less than 5%, between the two different simulation approaches. The design and simulation work presented herein provides the means to perform an optimization analysis, which reveals important clues as to how the energy cost could be reduced so as to make this technology a competitive alternative within the energy market.}

This study adopts a multi-model approach, integrating a model comparison to probe how the electrification of demand-side sectors and strategic load shifts of battery electric vehicles and heat pumps might impact Germany's generation adequacy by 2030. Specific demand models from the transport and heating sectors and a future load structure projection model are interlinked with three electricity system models. The comparative analysis of the three electricity system models unveils discrepancies in dispatch decisions for power plants, flexibility options' load shifts, and their effects on generation adequacy, directly tied to model attributes. The comparison underscores methodological variations (linear optimization versus agent-based simulation, myopic foresight versus perfect foresight) as pivotal, emphasizing the significance of considering load change and start-up costs for power plants. The results show that with optimized load shifting by electric vehicles and heat pumps, the adequacy of power generation is less strained despite increased electricity demand. Moreover, load shifts mitigate curtailment of renewables and consumers, reducing carbon emissions by lowering conventional power generation.}

However, their effectiveness is often hindered by strong dynamic coupling between the robotic arms and the satellite base in the microgravity environment. In this paper, both robotic arms are used as task arms, and a system model that considers the closed-loop constraint formed after a dual-arm space robot captures a target is established. On this basis, two types of control strategies, namely self-tuning control strategy (STC) and radial basis function neural network control strategy (RBF) are proposed for trajectory tracking of the target transferred or detumbled by the robot arms in the presence of system uncertainty or external disturbances. The control methods are verified and compared against the traditional computed torque control strategy (CTC) in terms of control accuracy and system robustness through simulation. The results demonstrate the excellent robustness of both RBF and STC strategies. RBF outperforms the other strategies in terms of control accuracy, while STC proves to be the most energy-efficient.}

abstract = {Background
Progress in addressing depression after traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been limited. Traditional approaches to measuring depression classify individuals with diverse symptoms as having the same problem. We adopted a novel, symptom-oriented approach to characterize post-TBI depression, emphasizing specific symptoms rather than the number of symptoms.
Methods
We assessed depressive symptoms cross-sectionally in 393 participants with moderate-severe TBI (range 0.4–35.4 years post-injury; M = 12.6) using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms – Expanded Version (IDAS-II). We analyzed symptoms of DSM-5 major depressive disorder (MDD), separating compound symptoms into sub-symptoms. We quantified depression heterogeneity across 16 specific symptoms and explored associations between each symptom and personal, injury-related, treatment, and functional/psychosocial outcome factors.
Results
28 % of participants self-reported a current depression diagnosis, and 35 % met DSM-5 symptom criteria for MDD. Depressed participants (according to either self-reported diagnosis or MDD symptom criteria) were more likely to endorse each specific depressive symptom, including those that overlap with TBI. Post-TBI depression was highly heterogeneous, with 84–91 % of depressed participants (depending on classification method) showing a unique symptom profile not shared with any other individual. The most common symptom profile was shared by only three individuals. This heterogeneity was meaningful, as specific depressive symptoms had distinct associations with personal, injury-related, treatment, and outcome factors.
Limitations
Cross-sectional design. We only analyzed DSM-5 MDD symptoms, and some symptoms were assessed using only one item.
Conclusions
A symptom-oriented approach to post-TBI depression captures the individual's unique profile of depressive symptoms, which relate differently to outcomes and other factors. We recommend future studies investigating post-TBI depression analyze specific symptoms alongside overall depression scores.}

A novel framework to depict the economic value of decentral flexibility units at different locations is presented: First, based on an energy system model, nodal as well as zonal price time series are generated. Second, flexibility values are computed based on these price time series using operation models. Our case study for 2030 for Europe demonstrates the high value of decentral flexibility provided especially by bidirectional flexibility options. The mean daily price spread is found to be a main driver for all flexibility values. We observe similar flexibility values across most nodes in both market designs. However, for a distinct subset of nodes that represent close to 10% of total demand, substantially higher values of local flexibilities are observed which indicates a markedly higher demand for flexibility. Yet, the zonal market design only provides imperfect incentives for the system-oriented operation of flexibilities at these nodes. Besides the introduction of nodal pricing as first-best option, we propose to consider tailored instruments focusing on these flexibility hot spots as second-best policies.}

With limited methods to navigate this multi-dimensional variability at scale, additive manufacturing stakeholders face challenges when making growth and investment decisions. To bridge this gap, this study applies system modeling methodologies to a case study of an additive manufacturing service unit in the sporting goods industry aiming to improve its product portfolio's economic and environmental impacts and scale its capabilities. A tradespace model compares the value of additive manufacturing to injection molding across product characteristics and life cycle decisions, and a flexible design analysis evaluates additive manufacturing scaling strategies, considering market and technology uncertainties. The tradespace analysis reveals that additive manufacturing reduces product environmental footprint by 95 % and unit cost by 93 % for 1-to-20-part production volumes compared to injection molding, while injection molding lowers environmental footprint by 72 % and unit cost by 56 % for 100-to-50,000-part production volumes compared to additive manufacturing. This analysis also suggests that additive manufacturing's economic and environmental value increases when located in geographies with low-carbon footprint energy and when manufacturing very low production quantities or small parts that maximize build capacity. The flexible design analysis indicates that expanding internal production capacity to a larger facility with renewable power, once higher demand is confirmed, can reduce part environmental footprint by up to 49 % and increase Net Present Value by more than 600 % compared to maintaining current operations that leverage external service bureaus. The results demonstrate the potential of these system modeling methodologies in integrating financial and environmental impact assessments at the company level for strategic scaling decisions. Future model developments are recommended to incorporate additive manufacturing's unique design impacts on the product life cycle, more nuance in the impact analyses, and the social component of the technology's sustainability.}

An experimental platform was constructed to analyze the effects of mass flow rates and inlet temperatures on the system's thermodynamic characteristics. Thermal management strategies were developed to optimize these parameters, significantly reducing thermal loads during high-speed flight and enhancing system efficiency and safety. Results indicate that variations in thermal energy input to a heat exchanger on one branch have a limited impact on another branch. The fuel mass flow rate can modulate the temperature of all working fluids in the system, but it also affects combustion characteristics. A transfer matrix-based system model with high accuracy was established, coupled with a genetic algorithm to achieve holistic identification of the heat exchanger heat transfer characteristics in practical applications, achieving a maximum parameter deviation of −4.79 %. The results contribute to optimizing TMS for aero engines, improving thermal stability, and enhancing energy utilization efficiency.}

Presently, there are hardly any corresponding system models in the literature dynamically simulating a PEM electrolyzer of this size. This paper introduces a first model approach for such systems, drawing on parameters from existing literature. It addresses the inconsistency found in the literature regarding the use of the exchange current density, which varies by a factor of 109. A novel optimization process is developed by using an auxiliary parameter to fit the exchange current density with a newfound condition between the anode and cathode side. The outcome is a comprehensive model of a PEM electrolyzer plant, exemplarily adapted to the Siemens Silyzer 300.}

One purpose of cultivating microalgae on building facades is to create an ‘active’ facade that can reduce the energy consumption required to maintain thermal comfort inside the building, by creating exchange loops between the building and the microalgae cultivation system. This paper describes the experimental validation of a thermal model of a building equipped with a biofacade PBR, and its use in analyzing the energy consumption of international-standard buildings in two different climate conditions (oceanic climate using the weather data from Nantes, France, and semi-arid climate using weather data from Los Angeles, USA). The results of this analysis show that the microalgae biofacade almost entirely removes the building's cooling demand, and the warmer the location the stronger the effect. In addition, the heating demand of the biofacade PBR is also greatly reduced (between 92% and 100% depending on the location). The microalgae biofacade is therefore a more sustainable solution to produce valuable biomass and a promising technology for the development of zero-emission buildings; to this end, suggestions for optimizing the process are put forward.}

Mid-scale hydrogen production for heavy-duty transport refuelling in Germany has the lowest LCOH at 8 €/kg (with a 16 MWel electrolysis system), whereas large-scale hydrogen production for the refinery industry in Portugal achieves 4 €/kg (with a 128 MWel system).

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) treatment remains challenging. This N-of-1 study evaluated a personalized integrative homeopathic protocol for MDD. Methods: A 28-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial assessed Sulphur fifty-millesimal potencies (LM4–7) effectiveness and safety in a 45-year-old female with MDD. The primary outcomes were Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores, and secondary outcomes included SF-12 and Clinical Global Impression Scale scores. We conducted Plasma proteomics and physicochemical analyses (SEM, DLS, ICP-MS) of Sulphur LM2–7.
Results
BDI-II scores increased significantly in the placebo group (P = 0.017), whereas no significant change was observed in the Sulphur-treated group (P = 0.243). Overall symptom improvement with homeopathy compared to placebo, controlling for baseline, was 78 % (p < 0.05). MCS-12 significantly decreased during placebo (P = 0.008) but remained stable during homeopathic treatment (P = 0.542). No significant PCS-12 changes were observed (P > 0.2). CGI-I scores improved during the run-in treatment but showed no further change during the N-of-1 trial. Sulfur-loaded LM formulations presented nanoparticles, as confirmed by SEM analysis, demonstrated distinct particle size characteristics via DLS, and exhibited quantifiable sulfur concentrations detected through ICP-MS. Proteomic analysis suggested that Sulphur treatment modulates immune response pathways, highlighting a potential mechanism underlying its antidepressant-like effects.
Conclusions
This personalized integrative homeopathic protocol demonstrated superior effectiveness to placebo in the studied individual. The physicochemical characteristics and proteomic findings indicate potential immunomodulatory effects mediated by nanomedicine mechanisms. However, further research involving larger cohorts is warranted to confirm these preliminary observations.}

We develop a typology of models of information capacity (infrastructural, system-by-system, and ad hoc) and explain how they influence policy implementation. We show how the infrastructural model is best equipped to absorb administrative burdens for a majority of citizens, while the system-by-system model and especially the ad hoc model tend to push costs towards frontline workers and citizens.

A novel comprehensive evaluation index, namely, the system net output per unit total mass flow rate (NOPF), is introduced to ensure that the analysis of system performance remains unaffected by the variations in the mass flow rate of the working fluid. The findings indicate that the operational modes exhibit diverse responses to influencing variables, while the distribution region of the operational modes is more sensitive to the separation ratio of the working fluid flow rate (X). Under the electricity-cooling generation mode of the system, the maximum NOPF reaches 156.01 kJ⋅kg−1. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves a peak exergy efficiency (ηex) of 13.83 %, concurrently decreasing the energy production cost (EPC) to a mere 0.0981 Dollar·kWh−1. Finally, this study offers new research insights that can inform future regional analyses of other multimodal and multigeneration systems.}

abstract = {Space heating constitutes approximately a quarter of final energy consumption in the European Union. Aligned with the ambition of the European Green Deal for climate-neutrality by 2050, effective energy system modelling is crucial for shaping strategies. However, integrating energy efficiency within the building sector remains challenging due to limited methodologies and data on specific energy consumption, heated surfaces, and retrofit costs. This paper proposes a methodology that balances accuracy and implementation effort through clustering analysis and relies entirely on open data primarily from the Hotmaps project to compute country-specific cost curves for energy savings in building space heating for each of the EU-27 countries. The aim is to empower energy system modelers to better incorporate energy efficiency measures into scenarios, thus advancing strategies in line with the European Green Deal. Findings indicate that the retrofits considered – insulation of façade, roof, ground floor; windows replacement – can save 40–60 % of space heating energy demand in most countries but marginal costs range widely, from 2 to 180 Eurocents invested per kWh saved over the retrofit lifetime. Climate conditions and existing insulation levels significantly influence the cost-effectiveness of these retrofits. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders working towards climate-neutral objectives.}

I exploit variation within schools and across grades in same-gender grademates’ average polygenic score—a linear index of genetic variants—for major depressive disorder (the MDD score). An increase in peers’ genetic risk for depression has immediate negative impacts on own mental health. A one standard deviation increase in same-gender grademates’ average MDD score significantly increases the probability of being depressed by 1.9 and 3.8 percentage points for adolescent girls (a 7.2% increase) and boys (a 25% increase), respectively. The effects persist into adulthood for females, but not males. I explore several potential mechanisms underlying the effects and find that an increase in peers’ genetic risk for depression in adolescence worsens friendship, increases substance use, and leads to lower socioeconomic status. These effects are stronger for females than males. Overall, the results suggest that there are important social-genetic effects in the context of mental health.}

Our approach integrates key hydrogen technologies within a detailed spatial investment and operation model – coupled with a European scale electricity market model. We focus on optimizing diverse infrastructure components including trailers, pipelines, electrolyzers, and storages to meet Austria's projected hydrogen demand. To accurately estimate this demand in hourly resolution, we combine existing hydrogen strategies and projections to account for developments in various industrial sectors, consider demand driven by the transport sector, and integrate hydrogen demand arising from its use in gas-powered plants. Accounting for the inherent uncertainty linked to such projections, we run the analysis for two complementary scenarios. Our approach addresses the challenges of integrating large quantities of renewable hydrogen into a future energy system by recognizing the critical role of domestic production in the early market stages. The main contribution of this work is to address the gap in optimizing hydrogen infrastructure for effective integration of domestic renewable hydrogen production in Austria by 2030, considering sector coupling potentials, optimal electrolyzer placement, and the design of local hydrogen networks.}

However, associated impacts on animals have remained largely unexamined and existing assessment approaches are still immature and often lack reflection on their normative assumptions and resulting implications. As animal welfare concerns increase, this represents a shortcoming, leaving a critical sustainability issue without due consideration. To address this, we develop a conceptual framework that guides the key decisions for assessing animal welfare impacts of foods. The framework is derived from an integrative literature review and revised following external feedback from expert focus groups. It bridges the research fields of food system modeling, animal welfare science and animal ethics and can guide researchers in developing assessment approaches and assessing animal welfare impacts of foods, from individual food items to whole diets. The framework also directs transparent communication of the most important assessment decisions. We outline key considerations for animal welfare assessments of foods, highlight associated challenges and discuss quality criteria as well as technical and normative strategies to address them. Our contribution provides a basis for future research to integrate animal welfare into sustainability evaluations of food and investigate tradeoffs and synergies with environmental, social or economic issues. Following this framework in future assessments facilitates the integration of animal welfare into food-related policy assessments and public decisions.}

abstract = {Cow-calf systems utilise grazing of native grasslands for beef cattle propagation and constitute the principal livestock activity in the Pampas and Campos areas. Cow-calf system sustainability is questioned because of their low production levels and negative environmental impact. Ecological intensification has been proposed as a way out that constitutes an alternative to dominant discourses based on increasing external-input use. There is, however, a considerable gap between the availability of scientific knowledge to promote the ecological intensification of cow-calf systems and farmers' practices. This gap between scientific knowledge availability and farmers' practices can be made explicit, and its consequences for systems performance can be explored through a conceptual model. Conceptual models are tools to build a systems view of the interactions among the production system's state variables, farm management, and resulting system performance. In this paper, we develop a conceptual model of cow-calf systems on native grasslands of the Pampas and Campos regions to support the diagnosis and redesign of farm systems towards ecological intensification. We apply the conceptual model to analyse cow-calf systems in Uruguay, drawing on a survey among 250 Uruguayan livestock farmers. Using the model, we show that in Uruguay, the level of implementation of strategic, tactical, and decision-supporting techniques is low. Consequently, most farms have poor control of the grazing intensity and timing of main events in the production cycle. This results in ample room to improve the productive and environmental performance of most cow-calf farms in Uruguay. We distinguished three broad types of cow-calf systems based on the degree of implementation of techniques, the evolution of state variables throughout the year, and productive indicators. These types imply different departure points and strategies for a sustainability transition process. The conceptual model designed in this paper may support the cow-calf systems sustainability transition in the context of co-innovation processes by aiding the interactive diagnosis and redesign of farm systems.}

Depending on their specific design, CfDs are known to affect investment and dispatch decisions in electricity markets. We evaluate these effects in a fully decarbonised, sector-coupled European electricity market in terms of their impact on the power system and from an investor’s and consumer perspective. We consider four different types of governmental CfDs awarded to wind onshore power plants in a competitive auction for the contracts’ underlying strike price. On the one hand, the CfD types differ in terms of the allowed direction and unit (energy vs. capacity) of payments with consequences for dispatch decisions. On the other hand, they apply different reference prices with implications for investment decisions as reflected by optimally derived strike prices. Implementing the CfDs in an energy system optimisation model, we find that these differences affect curtailment, electrolyser load and market prices in fully decarbonised electricity markets. From a consumer’s perspective, our results show that system costs are lowest for types of CfDs that foster investments in more system-friendly power plants. For investors, in turn, these types of CfDs incur the highest discrepancy of ex ante expected and ex post realised CfD payments, such that they do not necessarily suffice to recover their costs. We conclude that this could be addressed by an adequate risk premium on the strike price, which should be subject to future research.}

Energy system optimisation models (ESOMs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, their focus on cost minimisation limits their usefulness in addressing other factors like environmental sustainability and social equity. Moreover, by searching for only one global optimum, they overlook diverse alternative solutions. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by exploring near-optimal spaces in multi-objective optimisation problems, providing valuable insights for decision-makers. The authors extend the concepts of epsilon-optimality and necessary conditions to multi-objective problems. They apply this methodology to a case study of the Belgian energy transition in 2035 while considering both cost and energy invested as objectives. The results reveal opportunities to reduce dependence on endogenous resources while requiring substantial reliance on exogenous resources. They demonstrate the versatility of potential exogenous resources and provide insights into objective trade-offs. This paper represents a pioneering application of the proposed methodology to a real-world problem, highlighting the added value of near-optimal solutions in multi-objective optimisation. Future work could address limitations, such as approximating the epsilon-optimal space, investigating parametric uncertainty, and extending the approach to other case studies and objectives, enhancing its applicability in energy system planning and decision-making.}

The method is validated, and its utility is demonstrated in a case study. The NDLL accounts for dynamic and 3D effects through a panellized wake and allows the evaluation of the pressure distribution on hydrofoils. Improved models are presented for wake deformation, wake composition, hydrofoil interaction, and the viscous core of vortex wake models. Furthermore, an efficient way of accounting for Green function terms through a matrix interpolation method is presented. Validation is performed by comparison with aerodynamic and hydrodynamic experiments and new 3D RANS simulations. The RANS simulations focus on geometries and operating conditions deemed representative of hydrofoiling fast ferries. Predictions of steady and dynamic lift, drag, wake velocities and cavitation inception are evaluated, and results correspond well with the benchmark data. A simulator framework is introduced, which integrates the hydrodynamic model with kinetics, kinematics, and control system models. This enables analyses of free-running vessels under active control, including assessments of resistance, motions, and the hydrofoil pressure distribution. The case study constitutes a qualitative verification of the simulator and flight control tuning methods, and reveals the possibility of negative added resistance in waves.}

This work presents a prospective evaluation of a national electricity generation mix up to 2050 and discusses the increase in several critical and strategic materials used in this transition. Results indicate that the deployment of solar photovoltaics and wind energy will raise material criticality concerns in the coming decades. When comparing a decarbonisation scenario aligned with the 2030 Spanish policy with a business-as-usual scenario, results show that a higher penetration of renewables would involve increases of up to 53 % in silicon, 27 % in aluminium, 11 % in copper, and less than 1 % in other materials by 2050. Overall, the decarbonisation scenario would involve up to 12 % more materials. Furthermore, criticality indicators show increases of 0.06 % and 5 % by 2050 depending on the selected indicator. Differences in figures highlight discrepancies in the way criticality is evaluated, suggesting that further research is needed. Nevertheless, national long-term energy policies such as the Spanish one are urged to implement criticality issues in their formulation. Consequently, the authors recommend including critical material usage within energy and climate planning models.}

This study assesses the techno-economic trade-offs between national hydrogen targets and export goals, evaluating their alignment with climate commitments using the TIMES-MAGe model. Five scenarios explore variations in electrolysis energy sourcing (renewables vs. grid) and water supply (surface vs. desalinated), under both local-only and export-oriented strategies. Results show that while export-driven hydrogen production is feasible, it imposes significant economic and resource burdens. By 2050, exports sharply increase hydrogen production costs, electricity prices, investment needs, and water use. The competitiveness of renewable electricity is weakened as most renewable electricity is allocated to hydrogen exports, constraining domestic decarbonization. Intra-regional hydrogen trade is less cost-effective than domestic supply, with pipeline repurposing offering the most viable trade option. The findings inform future policy for cost-effective hydrogen development.}

Taking MATLAB/Simulink as a representative of a sophisticated and widely used modeling environment, we extend a multi-language comment taxonomy onto new (visual) comment types and two new languages: Simulink and MATLAB. Furthermore, we outline Simulink commenting practices and compare them to textual languages. We analyze 259,267 comments from 9095 Simulink models and 17,792 MATLAB scripts. We identify the comment types, their usage frequency, classify comment information, and analyze their correlations with model metrics. We manually analyze 757 comments to extend the taxonomy. We also analyze commenting guidelines and developer adherence to them. Our extended taxonomy, SCoT (Simulink Comment Taxonomy), contains 25 categories. We find that Simulink comments, although often duplicated, are used at all model hierarchy levels. Of all comment types, Annotations are used most often; Notes scarcely. Our results indicate that Simulink developers, instead of extending comments, add new ones, and rarely follow commenting guidelines. Overall, we find Simulink comment information comparable to textual languages, which highlights commenting practice similarity across languages.}

abstract = {Energy storage is a crucial flexibility measure to temporally decouple power generation from power demand and is touted as the missing link in realizing a decarbonized energy system based on renewable energy. Energy storage capacity buildup at all levels of the global energy system is expected to accelerate the decarbonization process. To this end, a coherent mathematical framework to ascertain the carbon footprint of localized energy systems with energy storage is indispensable. This article presents an open-source energy system simulation program — Energy System Network (ESN). A variety of energy system configurations can be simulated with the Python program, which incorporates key energy system components such as generation, grid, storage, and loads. ESN features an integrated bottom-up approach that combines energy system modeling with streamlined life cycle assessment techniques to quantify the carbon footprint of all components in a localized energy system. The lifecycle phases of each component, including production, operation, and end-of-life treatment, can be considered. Carbon footprint values are obtained for two demonstrative case studies with lithium-ion battery applications: energy arbitrage and home energy systems. The metric Levelized Emissions of Energy Supply (LEES) has been used to evaluate the carbon footprint of each application. An unconventional energy arbitrage strategy designed to exploit the grid carbon intensity spreads instead of the energy price spreads manages to achieve a LEES value about 17% lower than the conventional variant. The influence of rooftop solar generation, battery energy storage system, and the energy management strategy on the LEES values for a home energy system is explored. A maximum LEES reduction of over 37% vis-á-vis the base scenario was observed with optimal energy management for the solar generation and the battery system. The open-source availability of ESN can contribute to transparency, comparability, and reproducibility in carbon footprint assessments of localized energy systems with energy storage.}

The principal contribution of this study lies in the synthesis of insights gathered from the interviews and relevant literature, creating a theoretical framework of factors shaping LDES adoption. This framework is organised around six main themes and 20 subthemes, further classified into 102 key categories. The primary conclusion drawn from this structured analysis is the identification of multiple underexplored areas within the realm of LDES. Several of the identified main themes, as well as numerous subthemes and key categories, emerge as subjects necessitating further investigation. This study not only enriches our understanding of LDES adoption but also serves as a catalyst for future research initiatives to delve deeper into these overlooked facets, ultimately contributing to the holistic advancement of LDES technologies within the energy landscape.}

Psychological resilience, as a potential protective factor, has been linked to enhanced wellbeing and reduced psychopathology. This study investigated the predictors, associations, and prospective effects of resilience to daily hassles in both short-term (across days) and long-term (across months) contexts.
Methods
Daily resilience was measured through self-reported abilities to cope with daily hassles on a day-to-day basis for 30 days using Experience Sampling Methods in a sample of 86 outpatients diagnosed with depression.
Results
Daily resilience correlated with baseline depression (r = -0.31; p < .001), but not with the five other personal and social resources we investigated. As hypothesized, daily resilience co-varied with daily wellbeing on a day-to-day basis (p = <0.001), was predictive of shifts in wellbeing across days (p = <0.01), and associated with patients’ improvements in depression and dysfunction three months later (B = -0.48 & -0.49; p < .001) and six months later (B = -0.55 & -0.57; p < .001).
Limitations
It should be noted that the study's participants were recruited from a larger Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), and approximately 40% of patients experienced daily hassles. Despite this limitation, the findings suggest that daily resilience may hold promise as a crucial factor to inform intervention strategies and programs aimed at preventing depression relapse.
Conclusion
Daily resilience may well be a promising factor to inform intervention strategies and programmes that aim to prevent (relapse of) depression.}

abstract = {Energy system analysis is gaining more importance in political decisions, science, and society, thus, the basis of interpreting the results is increasingly being questioned. Different approaches have been used in energy system models: Scenario variations, changing base assumptions or sensitivity analyses. A direct comparison of these approaches aims to show that the influence on the results is comparable for all and thus needs to be considered alongside each other. Therefore, this paper uses energy system optimisation within a case study on Germany. It confirms that all approaches greatly influence the results and are thus suitable for discussing uncertainties. Among other things, the sole change of the reference weather year can have a comparable influence on the emissions just like the specification of an entirely different mobility scenario (+44% and +56% respectively). However, the target function (total costs) is significantly more influenced by scenarios. Among the evaluated parameters, the investment costs of renewable technologies and the potential of renewable feedstock affect the system the most. In summary, all three methods provide important insights into the optimisation model and should therefore be used together for validation, discussion and design of energy system models.}

Isoform-specific expression patterns have been linked to stress-related psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). To further explore their involvement, we constructed co-expression networks using total gene expression (TE) and isoform ratio (IR) data from affected (n = 210, 81% with depressive symptoms) and unaffected (n = 95) individuals. Networks were validated using advanced graph generation methods. Our analysis revealed distinct differences in network topology and structure. Shared hubs exhibited unique co-regulatory patterns in each network, with key master hubs in the affected network showing association with psychiatric disorders. Gene Ontology enrichment highlighted condition-specific biological processes linked to each network’s master hubs. Notably, isoform-level data uncovered unique co-regulatory interactions and enrichments not observed at the gene level. This is the first study to show network-level differences of gene and isoform co-expression between affected and unaffected individuals of stress-related psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the importance of isoforms in understanding the molecular mechanisms of these conditions.}

abstract = {This paper presents the formulation, design procedure, and application of a hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) scheme for hybrid systems that is embedded in a mixed logical dynamical (MLD) framework. The proposed scheme adopts a three degrees-of-freedom (3DoF) tuning method to accomplish precise setpoint tracking and ensure robustness in the face of disturbances (both measured and unmeasured) and uncertainty. Furthermore, the HMPC algorithm employs setpoint and disturbance anticipation to proactively enhance controller performance and potentially reduce control effort. Slack variables in the objective function prevent the mixed-integer quadratic problem from becoming infeasible. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through its application in three distinct case studies, which include control of production–inventory systems, time-varying behavioral interventions for physical activity, and management of epidemics/pandemic prevention. These case studies indicate that the HMPC algorithm can effectively manage hybrid dynamics, setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection in diverse and demanding circumstances, while tuned to perform well in the presence of nonlinearity and uncertainty.}

abstract = {Summary
Place and grid cells provide a neural system for self-location and tend to fire in sequences within each cycle of the hippocampal theta rhythm when rodents run on a linear track. These sequences correspond to the decoded location of the animal sweeping forward from its current location (“theta sweeps”). However, recent findings in open-field environments show alternating left-right theta sweeps and propose a circuit for their generation. Here, we present a computational model of this circuit, comprising theta-modulated head-direction cells, conjunctive grid × direction cells, and pure grid cells, based on continuous attractor dynamics, firing rate adaptation, and modulation by the medial-septal theta rhythm. Due to firing rate adaptation, the head-direction ring attractor exhibits left-right sweeps coding for internal direction, providing an input to the grid cell attractor network shifted along the internal direction, via an intermediate layer of conjunctive grid × direction cells, producing left-right sweeps of position by grid cells. Our model explains the empirical findings, including the alignment of internal position and direction sweeps and the dependence of sweep length on grid spacing. It makes predictions for theta-modulated head-direction cells, including relationships between theta phase precession during turning, theta skipping, anticipatory firing, and directional tuning width, several of which we verify in experimental data from anteroventral thalamus. The model also predicts relationships between position and direction sweeps, running speed, and dorsal-ventral location within the entorhinal cortex. Overall, a simple intrinsic mechanism explains the complex theta dynamics of an internal direction signal within the hippocampal formation, with testable predictions.}

abstract = {Hydraulic conductivity and compaction parameters are the key considerations in selecting lateritic soils for engineering construction. Nevertheless, the complexity and high cost of the required tests have driven many contractors and field engineers to skip them, resulting in a succession of engineering structure failures. To overcome this limitation, this study developed machine learning-based standalone GUI application to predict lateritic soils’ hydraulic conductivity (K), maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC) from indices including specific gravity, liquid limit, plasticity index, linear shrinkage and fine content. To achieve this goal, the geotechnical properties of three hundred samples, collected using grid sampling method from thirty different lateritic deposits in southwestern Nigeria, were evaluated through laboratory tests. The test results were used to train predictive models using artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The models’ performance was compared using coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Based on these performance metrics, ANN demonstrated the best performance (R2 = 0.9835, 0.9797, 0.9999; RMSE = 7.938, 0.252, 2.09E-08; MAPE = 0.288, 1.114, 1.587; MAE = 5.432, 0.169, 1.1E-08) for MDD, OMC and K, respectively, followed by GPR and then ANFIS. Thus, the ANN models were selected and embedded in a standalone GUI application to enhance easy and quick prediction of lateritic soils’ MDD, OMC and K. The validity of the ANN-based standalone GUI application was demonstrated by comparing it favorably to notable regression-based models in the literature.}

abstract = {This study investigates tumor density dynamics through computational modeling, focusing on key parameters: proliferation rate m, diffusion coefficient τ, and additional factors c and κ. Systematic exploration reveals nuanced interactions shaping tumor growth, regression, and dispersal. Higher m values accelerate proliferation, while increased τ facilitates dispersal. Parameters c and κ further refine our understanding of tumor behavior. These insights inform the development of computational models for oncological research, with implications for targeted therapeutic interventions. The aim can be realized by utilizing the propose Finite Volume Method to develop a representation of cancer models and improve the efficiency of their simulations. Furthermore, the numerical results will be validated by comparing them with the Tanh-Coth method formulation to assess the model's accuracy and efficiency. The findings suggest that accurate modeling of tumor dynamics can aid in predicting tumor progression and response to treatments, ultimately contributing to personalized medicine and more effective therapeutic strategies. Phase plane analysis shows the schemes are conditionally stable and accurate to the fourth order in time. The method demonstrates exceptional agreement and error-free findings compared to 3D plots, underscoring its potential utility in clinical and research settings.}
