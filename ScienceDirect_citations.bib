abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating illness that affects millions of people worldwide. Currently available antidepressants often take weeks to months to reach their full effect, which leads to an increased risk of suicidal behavior in patients with MMD. Intranasally, esketamine has emerged as an alternative to current antidepressants because of its rapid onset and long-lasting effects in patients with MDD. Animal models are useful for the initial pharmacological screening and for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of new drugs with potential against MDD. There is a lack of data on alternative routes of drug administration, either oral or injectable, that can be used in preclinical studies. This study aimed to test whether ketamine has antidepressant-like effects in mice when administered via nebulization using a low-cost apparatus. When mice whose depressive-like behavior was induced by corticosterone were treated with nebulized ketamine at concentrations of 1.3, 2.6, and 5.2 mg/mL, immobility was reduced by 38.6 %, 62.0 %, and 61.1 %, respectively, in the forced swimming test (FST) and 43.6 %, 42.1 %, and 57.9 %, respectively, in the tail suspension test (TST). When depression-like behavior was induced by dexamethasone, nebulization with ketamine reduced immobility by 79.7 %, 49.2 %, and 44.4 % in the FST and 80.9 %, 71.4 %, and 80.4 %, respectively, in the TST. When depression-like behavior was induced by the association between dexamethasone and unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) exposure, immobility was reduced by 26.1 %, 55.3 %, and 19.1 % in FST. Mice treated with nebulized ketamine did not show significant changes in the distance covered or in the time spent moving in the open field test. The efficacy of intraperitoneal and nebulized ketamine is equivalent, which shows that nebulization can be an alternative inexpensive route of drug administration for behavioral studies in rodents.}

abstract = {Background
There is ample evidence that socioeconomic status, objectively quantified by tangible resources, impacts mental health outcomes. However, the psychosocial mechanism linking objective socioeconomic status (OSS) with mental health is not clear. This study examined to what extent associations between OSS and the twelve-month prevalence of mental disorders, are mediated by the individual perception of social conditions—the subjective social status (SSS).
Methods
We employed data from the Iranian Mental Health Survey (IranMHS), collected through interviews with 7886 Iranian adults. We used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1) to assess any mental disorder, any anxiety disorder, and any major depressive disorder (MDD). We measured OSS based on education, occupation, wealth, and a composite OSS index, while SSS was evaluated using the MacArthur scale. We investigated the indirect associations and stratified the analyses by gender.
Results
In this national sample, 4499 (57.0 %) were women, 4380 (55.5 %) were urban, and the mean (SE) age was 31.7 (0.2) years. SSS had a partial to full mediating effect. Specifically, there were significant indirect effects for the impact of wealth (mediation percentage: 78.9 %), education (73.3 %), OSS index (56.0 %), and occupation (33.3 %) on any mental disorder through SSS.
Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the data presents constraints in establishing causal relationships.
Conclusions
Our findings highlight the role of SSS as the psychosocial mechanism linking OSS with mental disorders. A better understanding of the social factors that influence the association between OSS and SSS may enhance our insight into the mental health effects of socioeconomic status.}

This acute psychiatric condition is characterized by feelings of worthlessness, insomnia, extreme anxiety, or maternal neglect. Intranasal oxytocin (OT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have the potential to address impaired social cognition; nonetheless, their neuronal underpinnings, along with their safety and efficacy, are little comprehended. This study examines the effects of rTMS stimulation with an oxytocin agonist or antagonist in a PPD model. We employed the maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW) strategy for 21 days to attain our objective. Oxytocin acetate (agonist) and atosiban (antagonist) were administered by injection twice daily for three consecutive days following the model according to the established protocol. A single session of rTMS involved the application of high-frequency stimulation (20 Hz) one hour following the final injection. Behavioral testing and brain collection were conducted 12 h post-rTMS. The results indicated that treatment with OT followed by rTMS stimulation decreased neuronal cell death and microglial activation, meanwhile enhancing synaptic plasticity through the upregulation of PSD95, Synapsin I, and Synaptophysin. Simultaneously, both OT therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation demonstrated a significant capacity to alter autophagy activity and astrocyte function. Nonetheless, OTA therapy followed by rTMS did not exhibit the same pattern of outcomes. Our findings indicate that the combination of rTMS stimulation and an oxytocin agonist in a PPD model may mitigate depression-like behavior.}

abstract = {Background
Differentiating between patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is clinically challenging. This study aimed to explore the potential of radiomic textural features for discriminating BD and MDD.
Methods
A total 253 subjects (114 patients with BD, 139 patients with MDD) with T1-weighted MRI data were recruited. Radiomics features and gray matter volume (GMV) features were extracted from each brain region. A novel high-level MSN_II feature method based on radiomic features was proposed. And a total of 21 MSN features (5 MSN_I and 16 MSN_II) based on different combinations of the 5 types of radiomic textural feature were calculated. Classification models were constructed using various combinations of MSNs or GMV, and their performance and stability was evaluated through 2000 repeated experiments.
Results
The model built with combined features (GMV and GMV + MSN_II_GLCM_GLSZM_NGTDM) showed the best classification performance (AUC = 0.896±0.058, ACC = 0.831±0.064) in the validation cohort. After MANOVA analysis and FDR correlation, the MSN_II_GLCM_GLSZM_NGTDM values in 4 regions (right rectus gyrus, right temporal pole: middle temporal gyrus, Vermis3 and Vermis10) showed significant difference between BD and MDD.
Limitation
The main limitation of this study is that the data is derived from a single center without an external independent test set.
Conclusions
Incorporating the high-level MSN_II based on radiomics features can improve the classification performance compared to models solely relying on GMV features alone. This result implied the potential application of the proposed high level MSN method and radiomics textural features on the MDD and BD clinical studies.}

However, identifying the specific functional process associated with RSFC alterations is challenging, and it remains unclear whether alterations in RSFC for depressed individuals are directly related to the RNT process or to individual characteristics distinct from the negative thinking process per se. To investigate the relationship between RSFC alterations and the RNT process in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), we compared RSFC with functional connectivity during an induced negative-thinking state (NTFC) in terms of their predictability of RNT traits and associated whole-brain connectivity patterns using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) and connectome-wide association (CWA) analyses. Thirty-six MDD participants and twenty-six healthy control participants underwent both resting state and induced negative thinking state fMRI scans. Both RSFC and NTFC distinguished between healthy and depressed individuals with CPM. However, trait RNT in depressed individuals, as measured by the Ruminative Responses Scale-Brooding subscale, was only predictable from NTFC, not from RSFC. CWA analysis revealed that negative thinking in depression was associated with higher functional connectivity between the default mode and executive control regions, which was not observed in RSFC. These findings suggest that RNT in depression involves an active mental process encompassing multiple brain regions across functional networks, which is not represented in the resting state. Although RSFC indicates brain functional alterations in MDD, they may not directly reflect the negative thinking process.}

abstract = {Introduction
Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is an established treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and severe psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, catatonia (Kellner et al., 2012). Globally, ECT application varies significantly, particularly between depression and schizophrenia. In the United States, ECT is used for treating major depressive disorder, whereas treatment for schizophrenia is less common. Conversely, in many Asian countries, including Japan, and regions in the Middle East, ECT is more frequently administered for schizophrenia (Chanpattana et al., 2005; Chapattana et al., 2010; Younis et al., 2022). A survey of 23 Asian countries showed that 41.8% of ECT treatments were for schizophrenia compared to 32.4% for major depression (MDD)(Chanpattana et al., 2005). ECT literature from Japan reports similar trends, while in countries such as Spain and Switzerland ECT are primarily used for depression (up to 80% of treatments in reported literature) (Chanpattana et al., 2005; Vera, et al., 2016; Wilhelmy, et al., 2023). This analysis explores whether differences in ECT usage between depression and schizophrenia stem from treatment efficacy or are shaped by medical cultural differences. Despite the proven effectiveness of ECT treatment for other conditions outside of major depression or treatment-resistant depression, global usage of ECT is inconsistent with published literature as arbitrary restrictions limit access for patients with severe mental illnesses (Tor et al., 2021).
Methods
A case series including three cases of the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to treat geriatric patients with schizoaffective disorder. Patient symptomatic response and clinical improvement were assessed with the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S). Stabilization of mood was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).
Results
Case 1: 30-year-old male with a longstanding diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, who presented with a series of paranoia episodes over the series of a year. ECT was recommended to the patient as he was a prior responder; he received 77 ECT treatments in the clinic. Marked improvement in hallucinations, delusions, and speech latency were observed after five treatments. By ECT #11, the patient showed significant remission of psychotic symptoms and notable mood stabilization with a CGI-I of 1. By ECT #77, CGI-I was 2, CGI-S was 3, BDI was 13, GAD-7 was 4, and PHQ-9 was 6. Case 2: 48-year-old female with bipolar type schizoaffective disorder who presented with paranoia, delusions, anxiety, depression and mania. The patient previously received 22 ECT treatments the year before for refractory psychosis and depression; she received 54 ECT treatments in the clinic. At ECT initiation, the patient had a CGI of 6, BDI of 34, GAD-7 of 13, and PHQ-9 of 13. Symptomatic relief from paranoia and anxiety was apparent by the ECT #18, with a CGI-I of 3 and CGI-S of 5 along with gradual mood stabilization and reduction in manic episodes. By ECT #54, the patient reported a CGI-I score of 2, CGI-S of 2, BDI of 25, GAD-7 of 14, and PHQ-9 of 5. Case 3: 48-year-old male with depressive type schizoaffective disorder and fluctuating degrees of paranoia. The patient received 7 ECT treatments. Before treatment, CGI-S was 6, BDI was 39, and PHQ-9 was 22. After ECT #4, minimal improvements in paranoid thoughts and depressive mood were reported with a given CGI-I of 3, CGI-S of 5, BDI-II of 33, and PHQ-9 of 9.
Conclusions
Studies have shown that ECT treatment improves general functioning and reduction in verbal aggression and self-harm even extending towards C/M ECT (Continuation/Maintenance Electroconvulsive Therapy), demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment and its underutilization for schizophrenia (Iacu et al., 2015; Purohit et al., 2022). The wide variation amongst other countries in the use of ECT for the treatment of schizophrenia demonstrates that this is not a medical cultural difference and may be more indicated in patients with psychotic disorders including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (Sanghai et al., 2018). Research have demonstrated positive outcomes of ECT treatment in schizophrenia (and schizoaffective disorder) patients, highlighting the need for a wider approach to its application in countries.}

Three HUPS measures were analyzed: hassle frequency (HF), uplift frequency (UF), and the mean hassle intensity to mean uplift intensity ratio (MHI:MUI). Remission after treatment was not predicted by these baseline HUPS measures and did not moderate outcomes by treatment type. In contrast, HUPS measures significantly changed with treatment and were impacted by remission status. Specifically, HF and MHI:MUI decreased and UF increased from baseline to week 12, with remission leading to significantly greater decreases in HF and MHI:MUI compared to non-remission. ADM-treated patients demonstrated significant improvements on all three HUPS measures regardless of remission status. In contrast, remitters to CBT demonstrated significant improvements in HF and MHI:MUI but not UF; among CBT non-remitters the only significant change was a reduction in HF. The changes in HUPS measures are consistent with how affective biases are impacted by treatments and support the potential value of increasing attention to positive events in CBT.}

In this study, we examined the association between genetically predicted plasma proteins and treatment outcomes – including non-response, non-remission, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) – in 3559 patients with MDD from four clinical samples. Protein levels were predicted from individual-level genotypes using genetic scores from the publicly available OmicsPred database, which estimated genetic scores based on genome-wide genotypes and proteomic measurements from the Olink and SomaScan platforms. Associations between predicted protein levels and treatment outcomes were assessed using logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders including population stratification. Results were meta-analysed using a random-effects model. The Bonferroni correction was applied. We analysed 257 proteins for Olink and 1502 for SomaScan; 111 proteins overlapped between the two platforms. Despite no association was significant after multiple-testing correction, many top results were consistent across phenotypes, in particular seven proteins were nominally associated with all the analysed outcomes (CHL1, DUSP13, EVA1C, FCRL2, KITLG, SMAP1, and TIM3/HAVCR2). Additionally, three proteins (CXCL6, IL5RA, and RARRES2) showed consistent nominal associations across both the Olink and SomaScan platforms. The convergence of results across phenotypes is in line with the hypothesis of the involvement of immune-inflammatory mechanisms and neuroplasticity in treatment response. These results can provide hints for guiding the selection of protein panels in future proteomic studies.}

Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling condition, affecting approximately 280 million people globally. Emerging evidence points to a significant role of neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of depression. The soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (sTREM2) has been identified as a potential marker of neuroinflammation.
Objective
This study aims to investigate the potential mediating role of sTREM2 in the relationship between perceived stress, measured by the List of Threatening Events, and current depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive episodes (MDE).
Methods
This secondary analysis was conducted on data from a multicenter, case-control study of participants with current MDE (n = 39) and healthy controls (HC, n = 42). Plasma sTREM2 levels were measured using bead-based multiplex assays. Depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and Life-Threatening Events (LTE) were quantified with the Stressful Life Events Scale. A mediation analysis was conducted to explore the role of sTREM2 in the relationship between depression and LTE.
Results
Patients with current MDE exhibited higher plasma sTREM2 levels compared to HC (p = 0.006). Recent stress was positively associated with sTREM2 (p = 0.032), and both LTE scores and sTREM2 levels were significant predictors of current MDE (p = 0.009, p = 0.035). Mediation analysis showed that sTREM2 accounted for 17 % of the relationship between recent stress and depression (p = 0.028).
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that sTREM2 may play a mediating role in the link between stress and depression, highlighting neuroinflammation as a potential pathway in the development of depression.}

abstract = {Background
Panic disorder (PD) is a chronic and impairing anxiety disorder. Individuals with more sleep disturbances might be predisposed to nine-year PD chronicity. However, linearity assumptions, small predictor sets, and analytic and design limitations have hindered optimal identification of which sleep disturbance variables are distal risk factors for PD chronicity. We thus used machine learning (ML) to predict nine-year PD chronicity using high-dimensional data.
Method
Community-dwelling adults (N = 1054) completed clinical interviews, self-reports, and seven-day sleep actigraphy at Wave 1 (W1) and the same clinical interview at Wave 2 (W2) nine years later. The baseline data comprised 43 actigraphy, self-reported sleep disturbances, clinical, and demographic variables. Seven ML models were examined. Gradient boosting machine (GBM) was the best-performing algorithm. PD chronicity was defined as the presence of a PD diagnosis at both W1 and W2.
Results
The GBM accurately predicted PD chronicity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] =.764). Shapley additive explanation analysis showed that the top W1 predictors of PD chronicity were comorbid major depressive disorder, low healthcare utilization, sleep medication use, lengthier wake after sleep onset, and sleep-wake circadian disruptions based on actigraphy and self-reports. Lower household income and younger age were also top predictors. Additionally, the final multivariate model was well-calibrated.
Conclusions
As proposed in our sleep-panic nexus theory, actigraphy and subjective sleep disturbances have essential prognostic value in predicting long-term PD chronicity. Harnessing ML facilitates accurate prediction by identifying complex, nonlinear relations across high-dimensional datasets, possibly improving prevention and treatment tailoring.}

abstract = {Context:
Due to the proliferation of generative AI models in different software engineering tasks, the research community has started to exploit those models, spanning from requirement specification to code development. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a paradigm that leverages software models as primary artifacts to automate tasks. In this respect, modelers have started to investigate the interplay between traditional MDE practices and Large Language Models (LLMs) to push automation. Although powerful, LLMs exhibit limitations that undermine the quality of generated modeling artifacts, e.g., hallucination or incorrect formatting. Recording modeling operations relies on human-based activities to train modeling assistants, helping modelers in their daily tasks. Nevertheless, those techniques require a huge amount of training data that cannot be available due to several factors, e.g., security or privacy issues.
Objective:
In this paper, we propose an extension of a conceptual MDE framework, called MASTER-LLM, that combines different MDE tools and paradigms to support industrial and academic practitioners.
Method:
MASTER-LLM comprises a modeling environment that acts as the active context in which a dedicated component records modeling operations. Then, model completion is enabled by the modeling assistant trained on past operations. Different LLMs are used to generate a new dataset of modeling events to speed up recording and data collection.
Results:
To evaluate the feasibility of MASTER-LLM in practice, we experiment with two modeling environments, i.e., CAEX and HEPSYCODE, employed in industrial use cases within European projects. We investigate how the examined LLMs can generate realistic modeling operations in different domains.
Conclusion:
We show that synthetic traces can be effectively used when the application domain is less complex, while complex scenarios require human-based operations or a mixed approach according to data availability. However, generative AI models must be assessed using proper methodologies to avoid security issues in industrial domains.}

This systematic review explores how REM sleep and nightmares affect emotion processing and regulation in individuals with psychiatric disorders where emotion dysregulation is a key concern, suggesting novel sleep-related treatment pathways.
Methods
We performed a PRISMA-compliant systematic search of the PUBMED, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases from January 1994–February 2023. This systematic review targeted studies on REM sleep, nightmares, and emotion regulation in a postpubescent clinical population with affective dysregulation. The quality of the studies was assessed via the Newcastle‒Ottawa Scale (NOS), adapted for cross-sectional studies.
Results
From the 714 screened records, 28 articles met the inclusion criteria and focused on REM sleep, dreams, or nightmares in individuals with mood disorders (k = 8), anxiety disorders (k = 1), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (k = 16), non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), personality disorders (k = 2), and autism (k = 1). Fifteen studies used objective sleep measures, seventeen used self-reported assessments, six included treatment components, eight investigated nightmares, and three examined dreams. NOS scores ranged from moderate to high.
Conclusions
REM sleep disturbances represent a transdiagnostic feature across psychiatric disorders and are crucial for emotion regulation. Nightmares are associated with suicidal behaviour and emotion dysregulation. Targeted sleep interventions may improve emotion regulation and mental health outcomes. Future research should explore the role of REM sleep in disorder prognosis to develop tailored interventions.}

abstract = {Background
Reward processing dysfunction is a core characteristic of major depressive disorder (MDD), yet event-related potential (ERP) research in MDD has predominantly focused on reward receipt as opposed to anticipation. The stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) ERP reflects anticipatory brain processing. This study examines whether individuals with MDD exhibit deficits during reward anticipation as evidenced by altered SPN amplitude.
Methods
We assessed prefeedback-SPN amplitudes during a monetary incentive delay (MID) task in individuals with MDD (n = 142, 99 with comorbid anxiety disorders [MDD + ANX]) compared to Controls (n = 37). A mixed analysis of variance was performed on prefeedback-SPN amplitude and behavioral measures, with group (MDD, MDD + ANX, Control) as the between-subjects factor, and feedback (gain, loss) and electrode (F3, F4, Fz, C3, C4, Cz, P3, P4, Pz) as within-subjects factors.
Results
A group main effect revealed faster reaction times for the Control group than MDD and MDD + ANX groups. A group x feedback interaction indicated that the MDD subgroup had smaller prefeedback-SPN amplitudes than MDD + ANX and Control groups when anticipating gain feedback. Additionally, individuals with current MDD, irrespective of past MDD and comorbid anxiety, exhibited smaller SPN amplitudes than Controls prior to gain feedback.
Limitations
The MID paradigm, designed for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquisition, lacks optimization for ERP analysis. Moreover, the clinical groups included more females than the Control group.
Conclusions
Reduced resource allocation to reward anticipation may differentiate MDD from MDD + ANX and Control groups. Further investigation of the neural mechanisms of distinct MDD phenotypes is warranted.}

abstract = {The severity of major depressive disorder (MDD) is crucial in guiding treatment decisions for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), particularly given the high relapse rates post-ECT. Maintenance-ECT (M-ECT) has emerged as a key strategy to prevent relapse, with recent trends favouring symptom-driven approaches. This study explores the use of self-report scales as an adjunct to clinician-rated assessments in M-ECT decision-making, focusing on the Clinician-Rated 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C) and its self-report version (IDS-SR). In the Preventing Relapse After Successful ECT for Depression (PRASED) study, a subsample of 96 MDD patients were included upon achieving remission after an acute ECT course. Patients were stratified into relapse potential categories based on weekly IDS-C scores, determining the need for zero, one, or two M-ECT sessions the following week. Using five monthly IDS-C and -SR, the scales demonstrated good to excellent agreement, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.73 to 0.85 at multiple timepoints during M-ECT. Notably, 81 % of decision-making outcomes were concordant. Also, 16 % would result in patients receiving more ECT sessions based on the IDS-SR than the IDS-C, highlighting some overestimation by self-report scores. These findings indicate that self-assessment of depression severity by IDS-SR is a reliable alternative for clinician-rated measurements during M-ECT. Hence, this reduction of resource burden by self-report could facilitate the widespread implementation of personalised M-ECT, which may improve patient outcomes by reducing relapse rates in MDD. Future research should focus on validating self-report measures as reliable alternatives to clinician assessments in M-ECT to optimize treatment personalization and efficiency.}

This study investigated the association of polygenic scores (PGSs) for seven subcortical brain volumes (including the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and caudate nucleus) with treatment non-response and non-remission in MDD. Patients with MDD were recruited in the context of five clinical studies, including a total of 3637 individuals. PGSs were estimated using a Bayesian framework and continuous shrinkage priors (PRS-CS-auto) after standard genotype quality control and imputation. Logistic regressions were performed between PGSs and non-response or non-remission in each sample, adjusting for age, sex, baseline symptom severity, recruitment sites, and population stratification. Results were meta-analysed across samples, using a random-effect model. No association was significant in the meta-analysis after Bonferroni correction. The top finding was found for the caudate volume PGS and non-remission (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01–1.19, p = 0.036), with no evidence of heterogeneity. Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses showed that this result was influenced by the two largest samples in the meta-analysis.

abstract = {Background
Limited research has employed a longitudinal approach to investigate the role of education level as an effect modifier on the relationship between cancer diagnosis history and the experience of major depressive disorder (MDD) with a nationally representative sample.
Methods
We harnessed data from three installments of the MIDUS Longitudinal study (n = 7108). A Marginal Structural Model facilitated the investigation of associations between a history of cancer diagnosis, MDD, and potential modifying effects of education level. Inverse probability weighting helped manage confounding factors.
Results
Findings indicated that a cancer diagnosis made one year prior was linked with 3.741 times greater odds of experiencing MDD (95 % CI: 1.411–9.918, p < 0.01). This connection was absent for diagnoses made two years earlier. Among individuals with education up to high school, a recent cancer diagnosis significantly increased the likelihood of MDD in the subsequent wave by 3.45 times (95 % CI: 1.31–9.08, p < 0.05). This pattern was not apparent among better-educated individuals.
Limitations
As the exposure variable was dependent on self-reported questionnaires, recall bias could be a potential limitation. Moreover, unaccounted variables like genetic factors could introduce confounding.
Conclusions
A recent cancer diagnosis, particularly among less educated individuals, correlated with an increased probability of MDD, while the impact was not observed for older diagnoses. These findings emphasize that the timing of a cancer diagnosis and education level need consideration in the mental health assessment of cancer survivors.}

Responses to treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) vary widely, complicating clinical decision-making. Various clinical prediction instruments are available to support this process and potentially improve treatment outcomes. However, a systematic review to guide clinicians in choosing among these instruments is lacking.
Objective
To provide an overview of statistically evaluated clinical prediction instruments that are currently available for clinicians to assist in their decision-making processes. This review focuses on instruments accessible online or in print.
Methods
A systematic search following PRISMA/CHARMS guidelines in Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases was conducted from January 1, 2010, to March 1, 2023 (PROSPERO: CRD42021261469). Original studies in English reporting on prediction instruments for adults with MDD, available online or in print, were included. The risk of bias in these studies was evaluated using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST).
Results
Of the 5879 records screened, 111 full-text records were reviewed for eligibility, resulting in 15 original studies that reported on 16 unique prediction instruments. Most instruments (12 out of 16) were designed for use at the beginning or during treatment, while four specifically assessed outcomes after treatment. All studies had a high risk of bias.
Conclusion
This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of 16 prediction instruments immediately available for clinicians to support decision-making in depression treatment. For use at treatment initiation, we recommend instruments assessing prior treatments and clinical characteristics, such as the Maudsley Staging Method (MSM) or the Dutch Measure for quantification of Treatment Resistance in Depression (DM-TRD).}

abstract = {Model-based virtual sensing offers a viable approach for monitoring fatigue loads on operational offshore wind turbines. These methods combine response measurements with first-principle, or data-informed models, to estimate load time series at hard-to-access locations. However, their accuracy depends on the fidelity of the underlying model, which is largely influenced by uncertainties in the soil–structure interaction (SSI) models. This study evaluates the impact of different SSI modelling approaches in terms of a virtual sensing validation study targeting strain estimation above and below the mudline of a bottom-founded offshore wind turbine. To this end, different numerical models derived from, and validated against, design documentation serve as input to a dual-band modal decomposition and expansion (MDE) method. The considered SSI models range from an API/DNV-based foundation model to a PISA-based model including scour protection. Virtual sensing results are generated for two-year equivalent datasets, obtained for three operational offshore wind turbines, each equipped with extensive load monitoring systems. One turbine is used to assess the effect of the model updates, while two additional turbines are used to assess the across-site consistency. The estimated strains are directly compared against available strain validation data, in terms of damage-equivalent stress, and are accumulated to give a single comparative metric representative for the two-year periods. Results show that PISA-based soil reaction curves significantly improve agreement with measured strains while adding a scour protection model has a relatively smaller impact. These findings highlight the importance of accurate foundation modelling in virtual sensing and demonstrate the feasibility of fatigue monitoring at hard-to-access locations.}

We used Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WCNA) to identify metabolite clusters differentiating depressed and non-depressed individuals. Furthermore, WCNA revealed associations between biological parameters – previously associated with major depression − and the identified metabolite clusters. Including all identified metabolites, our results showed separation between participants with depression and non-depressed controls. WCNA identified ten metabolite clusters positively correlated with depression and one negatively correlated cluster. Several clusters indicated alterations in lipids and metabolites related to oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and inflammation, underscoring the significance of inflammatory activity and oxidative stress in depression. Subsequent pathway analysis assigned the metabolites to sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid, and glycerolipid metabolism, highlighting potential targets for further research and intervention. This study supports the view of depression as a pathophysiological condition associated with alterations in several biological parameters and reinforces previous findings on the role of lipid metabolism in depression, alongside alterations in inflammatory activity and mitochondrial bioenergetics. The data also revealed correlations between bacterial and plant metabolites and MDD, suggesting impaired gut epithelial integrity in depression.}

Nevertheless, the complexity and high cost of the required tests have driven many contractors and field engineers to skip them, resulting in a succession of engineering structure failures. To overcome this limitation, this study developed machine learning-based standalone GUI application to predict lateritic soils’ hydraulic conductivity (K), maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC) from indices including specific gravity, liquid limit, plasticity index, linear shrinkage and fine content. To achieve this goal, the geotechnical properties of three hundred samples, collected using grid sampling method from thirty different lateritic deposits in southwestern Nigeria, were evaluated through laboratory tests. The test results were used to train predictive models using artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The models’ performance was compared using coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Based on these performance metrics, ANN demonstrated the best performance (R2 = 0.9835, 0.9797, 0.9999; RMSE = 7.938, 0.252, 2.09E-08; MAPE = 0.288, 1.114, 1.587; MAE = 5.432, 0.169, 1.1E-08) for MDD, OMC and K, respectively, followed by GPR and then ANFIS. Thus, the ANN models were selected and embedded in a standalone GUI application to enhance easy and quick prediction of lateritic soils’ MDD, OMC and K. The validity of the ANN-based standalone GUI application was demonstrated by comparing it favorably to notable regression-based models in the literature.}

Numerous studies have highlighted the potential role of B vitamins in neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs), yet the exact causal relationship between these nutrients and NPDs remains unclear. In our Mendelian randomization (MR) meta-analysis, we examined the links between B vitamins (VB6, VB12, and folate) and NPDs, utilizing data from previous MR studies, the UK Biobank, and FinnGen databases. Our MR analysis revealed a complex, multifaceted association: VB6 appears to protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD) but may increase the risk for conditions such as major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. VB12 seems protective against autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but may heighten the risk for bipolar disorder (BD). Folate has shown protective effects against AD and intellectual disability (ID). The meta-analysis suggests that B vitamins may protect against certain disorders like AD and Parkinson’s disease, but they might also be risk factors for anxiety and other psychiatric conditions. Further subgroup analysis indicates that VB6 protects against epilepsy and schizophrenia but increases the risk of mania; VB12 protects against ID and ASD but raises the risk of schizophrenia and BD; folate protects against schizophrenia, AD, and ID. These findings reveal the intricate influence of B vitamins on mental health, emphasizing that different B vitamins have distinct impacts on various NPDs. This complexity underscores the importance of personalized supplementation in developing future therapeutic approaches for NPDs.}

abstract = {Speech signals are valuable biomarkers for assessing an individual’s mental health, including identifying Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) automatically. A frequently used approach in this regard is to employ features related to speaker identity, such as speaker-embeddings. However, over-reliance on speaker identity features in mental health screening systems can compromise patient privacy. Moreover, some aspects of speaker identity may not be relevant for depression detection and could serve as a bias factor that hampers system performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose disentangling speaker-identity information from depression-related information. Specifically, we present four distinct disentanglement methods to achieve this — adversarial speaker identification (SID)-loss maximization (ADV), SID-loss equalization with variance (LEV), SID-loss equalization using Cross-Entropy (LECE) and SID-loss equalization using KL divergence (LEKLD). Our experiments, which incorporated diverse input features and model architectures, have yielded improved F1 scores for MDD detection and voice-privacy attributes, as quantified by Gain in Voice Distinctiveness (GVD) and De-Identification Scores (DeID). On the DAIC-WOZ dataset (English), LECE using ComparE16 features results in the best F1-Scores of 80% which represents the audio-only SOTA depression detection F1-Score along with a GVD of −1.1 dB and a DeID of 85%. On the EATD dataset (Mandarin), ADV using raw-audio signal achieves an F1-Score of 72.38% surpassing multi-modal SOTA along with a GVD of −0.89 dB dB and a DeID of 51.21%. By reducing the dependence on speaker-identity-related features, our method offers a promising direction for speech-based depression detection that preserves patient privacy.}

There is rare study to capture the impact of depressive symptoms on the dynamic brain properties of ID patients. To address this gap, the present study used a novel method to calculate the stability of brain dynamic FC (sDFC) based on the sliding window approach. And this method was utilized to compare the dynamic brain properties between ID and IMD patients. Independent samples t-tests identified differences in the sDFC between the ID (n = 47) and IMD (n = 50) groups, and Pearson's correlations examined relationships between sDFC and sleep quality, insomnia symptom severity, and depressive symptoms severity in IMD patients. Results showed increased sDFC in the right supramarginal gyrus and left precuneus in IMD patients, and decreased sDFC in the bilateral putamen, bilateral thalamus, right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and right middle frontal gyrus. In IMD group, sDFC in the left precuneus was positively correlated with depressive symptoms, while sDFC in the right putamen was negatively correlated with insomnia symptoms, and in the left putamen and right SFG, it was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. This study is the first to directly compare dynamic brain properties between ID and IMD patients. The result provides a deeper understanding of how co-occurring depression in ID patients affects brain dynamics. The findings highlight potential target brain regions for future neuromodulation interventions, which could enable more effective and personalized treatments for patients with both ID and MDD.}

abstract = {Background
A diagnostic criterion for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is difficulty concentrating and increased distractibility. One form of distraction that occurs in everyday life is mind-wandering. The current study aims to test how individuals with MDD and healthy controls differ in their mind-wandering in everyday life.
Methods
Adults diagnosed with MDD (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 53) completed a week of experience sampling, with prompts administered up to eight times per day. At each prompt, participants reported the occurrence and characteristics of their mind-wandering. They also reported levels of momentary negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA), and rumination.
Results
MDD participants reported mind-wandering almost twice as often as healthy control participants. Compared to healthy participants, MDD participants rated their mind-wandering as more negative, but did not differ in terms of temporal orientation. Higher NA and lower PA predicted mind-wandering in the MDD group but not healthy controls, even after controlling for rumination. Time-lagged analyses revealed that current mind-wandering predicted future levels of PA in MDD participants but not in healthy controls; in contrast, current NA and PA did not predict future mind-wandering.
Limitations
Limitations include our examination of specific forms of mind-wandering (i.e., we did not sample the full spectrum of this construct).
Conclusions
Individuals with MDD frequently report engaging in mind-wandering in everyday life, and this appears to be coupled with affect. Mind-wandering may have maladaptive effects in MDD and could serve as a target for intervention.}

abstract = {Background
Existing evidence supports a correlation between multi-site chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but it is yet to be determined if this correlation is causal and in what direction the causation works.
Methods
Applying two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to data from available genome-wide association studies in populations of European ancestry, we estimated the causal association between multi-site chronic pain and no pain versus PTSD. Moreover, we used multivariable and mediation MR analysis to assess the mediating effects of 13 lifestyle factors or diseases on the causal relationship between multi-site chronic pain and PTSD. The MR analyses were mainly conducted with the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, followed by various sensitivity and validation analyses.
Results
Multi-site chronic pain dramatically increases the risk of developing PTSD (odds ratio [OR]IVW = 2.39, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.72–3.31, p = 2.10 × 10−7), and no pain significantly reduces the risk of developing PTSD (ORIVW = 0.12, 95 % CI = 0.05–0.30, p = 3.14 × 10−6). Multivariable MR found that 13 potential confounding factors do not influence the causal effect of multi-site chronic pain on PTSD. Moreover, body mass index (BMI) (6.98 %), educational attainment (8.79 %), major depressive disorder (MDD) (36.98 %) and insomnia (27.25 %) mediate the causal connection between multi-site chronic pain and PTSD.
Conclusion
Overall, individuals with multi-site chronic pain may be at a higher risk of developing PTSD, and this risk is partially influenced by the pathways involving BMI, educational attainment, MDD, and insomnia. These factors offer potential targets for therapeutic interventions.}

Sex differences in sleep disturbances during major depressive episodes (MDE) have been suggested. This study compares the prevalence, sociodemographic characteristics, and psychiatric comorbidity associated with sleep complaints specific to each sex among adults with MDE. These findings are crucial for precise diagnosis, personalized treatment, and improved clinical outcomes.
Methods
In a large nationally representative prospective survey, we used multi-adjusted logistic regression models including sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, and depression severity to examine whether associations differ between men and women.
Results
Among women, 93.3 % reported at least one type of sleep complaints (i.e., trouble falling asleep, early morning awakening or hypersomnia) while 91.0 % of men did, with respectively 78.3 % and 77.2 % of insomnia complaints, and 46.2 % and 41.3 % of hypersomnia complaints. Women with sleep complaints were more likely to be black, with lower individual incomes, have histrionic personality disorder or a specific phobia. Conversely, men with sleep complaints were more likely to have a lifetime diagnosis of mania spectrum disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, drug use disorder, as well as dependent and schizotypal personality disorders. Surprisingly, being “never married” has emerged as a protective factor against sleep complaints in women, while posing as a risk factor in men compared to other marital statuses. Differences and specificities were also noted concerning subtypes of insomnia and hypersomnia complaints.
Limitations
The cross-sectional design means the associations found do not imply causality.
Conclusions
These findings provide insights into the complex relationship between sleep and depression in men and women, highlighting the need for personalized interventions.}

abstract = {Objective
Patients suffering from severe mental disorders have a reduced life expectancy of 10–25 years compared to the general population, mainly due to the presence of physical comorbidities such us metabolic disorders. This study aims to explore the relationship between BMI and several clinical and sociodemographic factors in a sample of patients with affective disorders.
Methods
This is a naturalistic observational multicenter study carried-out in 7 Italian university sites. Patients aged 18–65 years with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD), diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteria, and in a stable illness phase, were recruited. Affective temperaments were assessed with the Munster Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego; impulsivity with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale; suicidal ideation with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale.
Results
A total of 598 patients were recruited. According to the regression analyses, the likelihood of having a higher BMI was increased by a higher trait-related impulsivity (p < 0.05), higher number of lifetime affective episodes (p < 0.05), male gender (p < 0.01), a depressive affective temperament (p < 0.05), use of lithium and of other antiepileptic drugs (p < 0.05). Conversely, a higher educational level reduced the likelihood of higher BMI (p < 0.01).
Conclusion
These findings highlight a strong link between BMI and impulsivity, number of affective episodes, temperament, gender and use of antiepileptics. Their routine assessment would be useful for an early identification of metabolic comorbidities and for the identification of patients at higher risk of having a worse physical outcome.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate whether AI-assisted ipsilateral tissue matching in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) reduces localization errors beyond typical tumor boundaries, particularly for non-expert radiologists. The technology category is deep learning.
Materials and Methods
The study consisted of two parts. In Part 1, 14 radiologists subjectively evaluated the AI tool’s impact on confidence and perceived usefulness on 11 cases. In Part 2, 12 radiologists marked lesion annotations with and without AI assistance after a washout period. Errors were measured relative to 94 consensus reference annotations in 30 cases established by two expert reviewers. Stratifications included expertise, lesion abnormality, and presence of DEVICE warnings (indicating high uncertainty in the computed mapping). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests assessed statistical significance.
Results
In Part 1, radiologists reported improved confidence and a mean usefulness score of 6.21/10 (p < 0.001), with greater benefit in challenging cases. In Part 2, root mean square error (RMSE) and maximum distance error (MDE) for abnormal lesions were 32 % (11.70 mm vs 8.88 mm) and 37.5 % higher (20.68 mm vs 15.08 mm), respectively, without AI assistance (p < 0.05). Non-expert readers showed the greatest benefit, with RMSE (12.20 mm vs 7.57 mm, p < 0.01) and MDE (15.76 mm vs 9.47 mm, p < 0.05) reduced by over 60 %. These reductions are clinically relevant given typical screen-detected breast tumor sizes (median, 13 mm [IQR: 9–20 mm]).
Conclusion
AI-assisted tissue matching significantly improved localization accuracy, especially for non– expert readers and in complex cases. The AI warning system effectively identified high-uncertainty cases. Errors were reduced to within typical tumor dimensions, potentially preventing missed lesions.}

To evaluate the effect of Brahmi vati and Aswagandarista in the management of MDD.
Methods
Study was a Randomized, Controlled, parallel group comparative clinical trial. Fifty patients meeting the MDD (DSM V) diagnostic criteria from teaching hospital were recruited in the study. They were divided in two 2 groups. Control group were administered with Escitalopram 10 mg twice a day. Ayurveda group were intervened with tablet Brahmi vati 500 mg thrice a day and Liquid Aswagandarista 10 ml thrice a day. Interventions were for 60 days. Assessments were done on every 15th day. Assessments criteria included Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HARS), UKU Side effect scale (UKU), Brief Psychotic Rating Scale (BPRS), WHO quality of life -BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Clinical Global Impression scales (CGI) were assessed at all the time points. Blood parameters like Haemoglobin, Serum creatinine and Liver function tests were evaluated at pre and post study.
Results
Between group comparison showed significant improvements in WHOQOL-Bref (p < 0.001), UKU (p = 0.04) favouring Ayurveda group and PSQI (p = 0.02) improvements in control group. Improvements in other parameters were comparable. Within group assessment showed significant (p < 0.001) improvement in HDRS, HARS, BPRS, CGI-S, CGI-GI in both the groups. Liver function tests and serum creatines were within normative limits.
Conclusion
Ayurveda medications produced significant improvements comparable to escitalopram with additional advantages in quality of life and side effects profile.}

Multiparticulate drug delivery systems (MDDS) are promising carriers to improve the performance of drugs. We developed BZ-loaded MDDS intended for improving Chagas disease therapy. To assess their efficacy and safety, Trypanosoma (T) cruzi infected BALB/c mice were orally treated with free BZ or BZ-MDDS at different regimens (doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, administered daily or at 2- or 5-days intervals) and compared with infected non-treated (INT) mice. At 100 mg/kg/day, independent of the administration regimen, both treatments were able to override the parasitemia, and at 50 mg/kg/day significantly reduced it compared to INT mice. BZ-MDDS at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day administered every 5 days (BZ-MDDS 100–13d) induced the lowest cardiac parasite load, indicating an improved efficacy with lower total dose of BZ when loaded to the MDDS. Reactive oxygen species produced by leukocytes were higher in INT and mice treated with BZ at 50 mg/kg/day compared to 100 mg/kg/day, likely because of persistent infection. BZ-MDDS treatments markedly reduced heart and liver injury markers compared to INT mice and those receiving the standard treatment. Therefore, BZ-MDDS exhibited enhanced activity against T. cruzi infection even at lower doses and reduced administration frequency compared to free BZ while increasing the treatment safety. They likely avoid undesired side effects of BZ by keeping a sustained concentration, avoiding plasmatic drug peaks. BZ-MDDS evidenced significant improvements in experimental Chagas disease treatment and can be considered as a potential improved therapeutic alternative against this illness.}

To evaluate biomarkers that assist in the identification of electroencephalography signals in patients with depression, utilizing an ensemble learning model.
Methods:
XGBoost ensemble model was trained and tested to classify patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n=24) and healthy controls (HCs) (n=29) from the multi-modal open dataset for mental-disorder analysis. Based on event-related potentials (ERPs) to emotional-neutral face pairs (Happy-Neutral, Sad-Neutral, Fear-Neutral) as stimuli, we segmented six conditions: 3 emotional cues, dots (happy, sad, and fear) and applied the FisherScore feature selection method to select the waveform features with high mutual information. Overall, 80% of the data was selected to establish the XGBoost model with five-fold cross-validation.
Results:
We identified happy, sad and fear conditions with waveform features (170–230 s) to distinguish patients with depression. The proposed XGBoost model had a comprehensive accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under curve of 99.52%, 99.39%, 99.67%, 99.52%, and 99.98% for the ERPs. Furthermore, our experimental results indicated that suppression of the amplitude of negative emotional cues could be used to recognize depression, which was predominantly over the frontal lobe and frontal poles regions. The response latency of ERP signals contributed significantly to distinguishing between HCs and patients with MDD.
Conclusion:
An ensemble learning system for classification using the XGBoost and feature selection using FisherScore has the potential to be used in clinical prediction of depressive symptoms in patients with MDD.
Significance:
The discovery of ERPs as a biomarker has important clinical implications for exploring the pathogenesis behind MDD.}

Dynamic analysis is a prominent approach for understanding the real-behavior of Android malware. Malware mainly use evasions to underperform dynamic analysis. Although different approaches have been proposed to tackle evasive malware, they suffer from several limitations, e.g. most of them use static analysis to detect the evasions which can be defeated by using anti static analysis techniques. On the other hand, to defeat the evasions, they use different execution methods that cause crashes in some cases. To address the challenges of detecting and defeating malware evasions, we propose Maaker, a novel framework that utilizes both static and dynamic analyses through hybrid execution along with a human in the loop approach. Maaker takes advantage of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) to facilitate putting the human in the loop in order to use his/her knowledge to tackle different evasions for extracting the real malicious behavior with little effort. Maaker is compared with Ares, IntelliDroid and Defuzer tools. We used malware samples from AMD dataset to compare the tools regarding some criteria including the number of detected evasions, reached targets, required executions, and the time required to reach the targets. Evaluation results show that Maaker outperforms the three rival tools regarding effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.}

In this study, we examined ER as a mechanism of change in outpatient, group-based ER-focused psychotherapy for MDD, conducting secondary analysis of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. Depressive symptom severity (DSS) and ER were assessed five times during an 8-week Affect Regulation Training (N = 73). Firstly, we tested cross-sectional correlations of ER and DSS at all assessment points. Then, we employed latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) to explore associations between changes in ER and DSS during treatment. Finally, we applied bivariate latent change score modeling (LCS) to test whether improvements in ER skills predicted subsequent reductions in DSS. Cross-sectional analyses revealed negative correlations between ER and DSS at all time points. Longitudinal LGCM analyses showed that an increase in ER skills during treatment was associated with a decrease in DSS. Finally, LCS analyses indicated that changes in ER predicted subsequent changes in DSS, whereas the reverse relationship was not significant. These finding support a causal relationship between the enhancement of ER skills and subsequent reduction of DSS, highlighting the importance of ER as a mechanism of change in the treatment of depression. Future research should extend these analyses to other disorders beyond depression to further clarify the role of ER as a critical transdiagnostic factor and a promising treatment target for a wide range of mental health conditions.

abstract = {Background
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in neuroplasticity and has been implicated in both the pathophysiology of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and treatment effects. Unlike serum BDNF (s-BDNF), which largely reflects platelet-derived BDNF released during coagulation, whole blood BDNF (wb-BDNF) measures the total blood BDNF pool, minimizing confounds related to platelet aggregation. This study aims to assess whether wb-BDNF levels can serve as a biomarker for MDD and/or as a predictor of antidepressant treatment response.
Methods
We measured wb-BDNF before and after 4–12 weeks of escitalopram intervention in two studies: a non-randomized, single-arm clinical trial of 97 unmedicated patients with MDD and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 66 healthy controls (HC). The BDNF Val65Met polymorphism was also determined.
Results
Unmedicated patients with MDD had 14 % lower wb-BDNF than HC, but wb-BDNF prior to intervention was not associated with symptom severity, nor did it predict drug treatment outcome in the patients. Further, improvements in depression scores after 8 and 12 weeks of escitalopram was not associated with changes in wb-BDNF. In HC, wb-BDNF was similar in the placebo and escitalopram groups after 4 weeks of intervention. BDNF polymorphism was similar between HC and MDD, and responders and non-responders, and was not associated with wb-BDNF levels.
Conclusion
wb-BDNF reflects the total blood BDNF pool and avoids platelet aggregation-related confounds seen in s-BDNF measures. wb-BDNF could be used as diagnosis but not as a prognosis biomarker, in MDD. Further research is needed to investigate changes in BDNF reservoirs and their implications.}

abstract = {Background
The long-term effectiveness of vortioxetine for facilitating progress toward personal recovery goals and improving productivity at work was assessed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
Methods
Single-arm, prospective, 24-week cohort study in employed patients with MDD initiating treatment with vortioxetine (n = 121) in outpatient settings in Japan. The Goal Attainment Scale for Depression (GAS-D) was used to evaluate progress toward personal recovery goals. At baseline, a combination of patient-defined and pre-specified goals was established collaboratively with the treating psychiatrist, followed by longitudinal assessments at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. Work-related productivity was assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire. Co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving their pre-specified personal recovery goals at week 12 and the change in work productivity from baseline.
Results
In all, 45/107 patients (42.1%) had achieved their personal recovery goals at week 12, increasing to 62/100 (62.0%) at week 24. Significant improvement was observed across all WPAI domains (i.e., absenteeism, presenteeism, productivity loss, and activity impairment) at week 24. Depressive symptoms, global patient functioning, emotional and cognitive symptoms, cognitive performance, and quality of life also significantly improved over the 24 weeks of follow-up. At week 24, 80/102 patients (78.4%) remained on vortioxetine; 49 of these patients (61.3%) were receiving vortioxetine 20 mg/day.
Limitations
Open-label study.
Conclusions
Vortioxetine was found to be effective in helping to achieve personal recovery goals and in enhancing workplace productivity over the 6-month study period in patients with MDD.

abstract = {Background
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent in youth. Conventional treatment paradigms primarily involve selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and psychotherapy, yet a significant proportion of this population exhibits treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In adults, interventional therapies like Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), and ketamine have shown promise for TRD, but their comparative efficacy remains underexplored in Adolescent and pediatric population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the relative effectiveness of ECT, rTMS, and ketamine in treating TRD among adolescents.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched databases for studies of ECT, rTMS, or ketamine for treatment-resistant depression in youth ages 10–24. Three reviewers independently screened for inclusion based on predefined criteria. Included observational and randomized controlled trials reported depression symptoms with measures like HDRS and MADRS in youth treated with ECT, rTMS, or ketamine. Two reviewers extracted data on interventions, patients, and depression symptom outcomes. Chance-adjusted inter-reviewer agreement was calculated. For meta-analysis, we pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) in depression scores using random effects models and assessed heterogeneity with I2 statistics.
Results
Meta-analysis of 10 observational studies examined SMD in depression scores for treatment resistant depression patients treated with ECT, ketamine, or rTMS. Patients treated with ECT had a significantly lower SMD of 1.99 (95 % CI 0.92–3.05, p < 0.001) compared to baseline. Patients treated with ketamine also had a significantly lower SMD of 1.58 (95 % CI 1.04–2.12, p < 0.001). Patients treated with rTMS had the lowest SMD of 2.79 (95 % CI 0.79–4.80, p = 0.006). There was no significant difference between the three groups overall (p > 0.05). Comparative analysis between ECT and ketamine found no significant difference in SMD (p = 0.387). Comparison of ECT versus rTMS found a significant difference in SMD favoring rTMS (p = 0.004). Comparison of ketamine versus rTMS suggested a potential difference in SMD favoring rTMS (p = 0.058). In summary, rTMS resulted in significantly larger reductions in depression scores than ECT, and potentially larger reductions than ketamine.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis illustrates the ability of rTMS, ECT, and ketamine to improve depression in youth. rTMS resulted in the largest improvements, highlighting its potential as a first-line treatment for pediatric treatment-resistant depression given its favorable side effect profile compared to ECT. Further research directly comparing these modalities is needed.}

This study investigated the effects of accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS) on SC-FC coupling and graph theory measures, focusing on the association between baseline SC-FC coupling of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and clinical improvement. In a randomized, sham-controlled, quadruple-blind, crossover study, aiTBS was delivered to the left dlPFC of depressed patients with MDD, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data were acquired. In 77 MDD patients, significantly increased whole-brain SC-FC coupling was observed, primarily driven by default mode network (DMN) SC-FC coupling, along with increased somatomotor network FC, and decreased FC between the DMN hubs and limbic regions after active aiTBS. Furthermore, significant increases were observed in structural global and local efficiency measures that were not specific to the stimulation condition (active/sham aiTBS). However, these changes did not significantly correlate with clinical improvement. Notably, baseline SC-FC coupling of the left dlPFC was a significant predictor of clinical improvement. Our findings highlight the potential of left dlPFC SC-FC coupling as a predictor of aiTBS treatment outcomes, as well as the effect of aiTBS in enhancing SC-FC coupling.}

This study analyzed pre-existing data to investigate whether speech features extracted from semi-structured interviews with a virtual avatar could enhance traditional diagnostic approaches by utilizing automated voice analysis, which can detect nuances beyond human hearing, potentially improving sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing PTSD. Leveraging the DAIC-WoZ dataset (Gratch et al., 2014), which includes 142 dialogues (average length: 954 s) between participants and a virtual avatar, we extracted content and acoustic features from transcripts and audio recordings. Group comparisons aimed to identify differences between PTSD and non-PTSD participants, as well as distinctions between PTSD participants with and without comorbid depression. Key findings revealed that PTSD participants expressed more negative sentiment in their speech (η²=0.82, p < 0.001) and used less frequent words (η²=0.65, p < 0.001) compared to controls. To demonstrate the utility of speech features, classification models were developed to differentiate PTSD and control participants. A linear model with twenty-one speech features (balanced accuracy = 0.70) outperformed a model based solely on demographic data (balanced accuracy = 0.53). Subgroup analyses found no significant differences in speech features between PTSD participants with and without comorbid depression. These results suggest that automated speech analysis, facilitated by virtual avatars, can identify linguistic markers of PTSD, potentially aiding diagnosis and reducing barriers to disclosure. However, further research is needed to generalize these findings and explore their utility in clinical practice.}

Multiple factors contribute to suicide risk, such as depression and a history of attempted suicide among other biological, psychological, and social factors. Although the examination of suicidality in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) occupies a substantial place in the literature, limited focus has been given to the application of explainable AI for the interpretation of suicide behavior taking into account suicide-related psychological variables. This study explored an ML pipeline via comparative, statistical, and post-hoc analyses to predict suicidal behaviors in patients diagnosed with MDD (N = 273 patients) by identifying specific risk and protective factors linked with clinically significant suicide risk. The results showed that LightGBM classifier presented the best overall performance, reaching 0.895 ROC-AUC score with parameter tuning. High depressive symptomatology from young age, high fear of dependence and interpersonal intimacy as well as interpersonal rejection or abandonment, and previous suicide attempts were identified as risk factors, while access to mental health care services, having a family, and being employed were found to be protective factors. The results showed that a mix of heterogenous factors should be incorporated for better interpreting suicidal behaviors, including psychological factors, such as attachment style, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, explainable AI appears to be a promising means for identifying MDD patients with high risk of suicidality, contributing to tailor-made clinical interventions.}

This paper explores that the large language models can effectively understand depth with minimal supervision, using efficient resource utilization and a consistent neural network architecture. We propose Large Language Model-Monocular Depth Estimation (LLM-MDE), a unified framework that treats depth estimation as a language-reasoning problem. A frozen Vision Transformer first encodes an image; cross modal reprogramming then aligns visual tokens with a small set of learned text prototypes, and an adaptive depth prompt generator turns simple image statistics into natural-language cues that guide a pretrained large language model. Only lightweight Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adaptors are tuned, keeping the computational cost low. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of LLM-MDE, which excels in few/zero-shot tasks while minimizing resource use. These show that large language models, when guided by minimal visual reprogramming and adaptive prompts, can reason about geometric structure without prior vision-specific training, opening a practical path to low-resource MDE on edge devices.

The current study used a retrospective study design to investigate the association between age of onset of severe mental disorders in offspring and the likelihood of diagnoses of parental mental disorder.
Method
We enrolled 212,333 people with severe mental disorder, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BD), or major depressive disorder (MDD) and 2,123,329 controls matched for age, sex, and demographics from the National Health Insurance Database of Taiwan. Poisson regression models were used to examine the likelihood of diagnoses of five mental disorders in their parents compared to the parents of the controls (reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval), including schizophrenia, BD, MDD, alcohol use disorder (AUD), and substance use disorder (SUD). The study cohort was classified into child-onset, adolescent-onset, and adult-onset groups according to the onset of severe mental disorders in the offspring.
Result
The parents of people with child-, adolescent-, and adult-onset schizophrenia (OR range: 1.73–9.08, all p < 0.05) or BD (OR range: 1.97–8.17, all p < 0.05) were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, BD, MDD, AUD, and substance use disorder (SUD) than controls except for AUD in the child-onset group. However, the parents of people with child-, adolescent-, and adult-onset depressive disorder were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, BD, MDD, AUD, and SUD (OR range: 1.82–4.76, all p < 0.05) than controls. Sub-analyses stratified by sex showed different patterns of associations between parental mental disorders and offspring mental disorders.
Conclusion
No matter when the severe mental disorder of the offsprings occurred at different onset stages, their parents had a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with schizophrenia, BD, MDD, AUD, and SUD.}

keywords = {Depression, Anxiety, Repetitive negative thinking, Brooding, Error-related negativity (ERN), Stop-signal task},
abstract = {Background
Repetitive negative thinking (RNT), particularly its brooding aspect, is a prominent feature in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with and without comorbid anxiety. Error processing, an adaptive cognitive operation, seems to be impaired in individuals with exaggerated RNT. This study measured a post-error neural response, error-related negativity (ERN), during an inhibitory task to examine the mechanism underlying the relationship between RNT and faulty error processing.
Methods
We examined current MDD patients with (n = 61) and without comorbid anxiety disorders (COM; n = 38), propensity-matched into High- or Low-RNT groups according to Ruminative Response Scale Brooding subscale scores. Using 32-channel electroencephalography (EEG) during a stop-signal task, we measured baseline-corrected ERN amplitude at FCz 0–100 ms after an incorrect response. A between-subjects ANOVA was conducted with group (High RNT, Low RNT) and comorbidity (MDD, COM) as factors.
Results
A significant group-by-comorbidity interaction (η2 = 0.07) was found, with MDD participants exhibiting high RNT revealing smaller (more positive) ERN amplitudes compared to their COM counterparts with high RNT (d = 0.77) and MDD participants with low RNT (d = 0.92).
Conclusions
Non-anxious individuals with MDD and high RNT showed blunted post-error neural responses, potentially indicating a diminished adaptive neural mechanism for recognizing and correcting errors. However, the presence of comorbid anxiety disorders in individuals with high RNT appears to counteract this reduction, potentially through an enhanced neural response to errors, thereby maintaining a higher level of error-processing activity. Further understanding of these relationships is essential for developing targeted interventions for MDD, with particular focus on the detrimental impact of brooding RNT.}

This study enrolled 2470 hospitalized patients with BD (n = 1333) or MDD (n = 1137) at reproductive age from 2009 to 2018 in China. We extracted 8 parameters, uric acid (UA), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IDBIL), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and prealbumin of male, patients and 12 parameters, UA, DBIL, IBIL, LDH, FT3, TSH, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), white blood cell (WBC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of female patients. Backward stepwise multivariate regression analysis and the Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) segmentation analysis via SPSS Decision Tree were implemented to define the discrimination of BD and MDD.
Results
DBIL was extracted as the first splitting variable, with LDH and IBIL as the second, TSH and prealbumin as the third in the model of male patients (p-value < .05). For the model of female patients, DBIL was also extracted as the first splitting variable, with UA, LDH, and IBIL as the second, triglyceride and FT3 as the third (p-value < .05). The predictive accuracies of the Decision Tree and multiple logistic regression models were similar (74.9% vs 76.9% in males; 74.4% vs 79.5% in females).
Conclusions
This study suggests the value of the Decision Tree models, which employ biochemical parameters as diagnostic predictors for BD and MDD. The CHAID Decision Tree identified that patients with concomitantly increased LDH, IBIL, and decreased DBIL could be in the group that showed the highest risk of being diagnosed as BD.}

abstract = {Anxiety and inflammation are complex, interconnected physiological processes. The “Conflict Avoidance Theory of Inflammation-Induced Anxiety” (CATIA) hypothesizes that inflammation-induced anxiety confers an evolutionary advantage by promoting harm-avoidance and recovery-promoting behaviour. Inflammatory cytokines act as signalling molecules to anxiety-related brain regions, primarily limbic structures such as the amygdala, thus influencing decision-making and behaviour. This is archieved by priming these structures for exaggerated fear-responses counteracting conflict engagement, when adaptive physiological readiness is impaired. This adaptive mechanism prioritizes recovery and survival during illness or injury. However, in modern contexts, inflammation driven by lifestyle factors or chronic conditions may perpetuate anxiety symptoms, contributing to psychiatric disorders like generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Understanding the psychoneuroimmunologic underpinnings of CATIA may inform screening, prevention, and treatment strategies for anxiety-associated disorders. Therefore, we propose clinical applications particularly for clearly defined vulnerable populations affected by inflammation-induced anxiety. These vulnerable populations could be detected using a “screening & scoring system”, and personalized treatment options could then be applied according to a defined algorithm. Although the literature widely supports the theoretical background of CATIA, the hypothesis is thus far untested and needs further investigation. We outline specific suggestions how this could be achieved in a clinical context.}

abstract = {Background
Progress in addressing depression after traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been limited. Traditional approaches to measuring depression classify individuals with diverse symptoms as having the same problem. We adopted a novel, symptom-oriented approach to characterize post-TBI depression, emphasizing specific symptoms rather than the number of symptoms.
Methods
We assessed depressive symptoms cross-sectionally in 393 participants with moderate-severe TBI (range 0.4–35.4 years post-injury; M = 12.6) using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms – Expanded Version (IDAS-II). We analyzed symptoms of DSM-5 major depressive disorder (MDD), separating compound symptoms into sub-symptoms. We quantified depression heterogeneity across 16 specific symptoms and explored associations between each symptom and personal, injury-related, treatment, and functional/psychosocial outcome factors.
Results
28 % of participants self-reported a current depression diagnosis, and 35 % met DSM-5 symptom criteria for MDD. Depressed participants (according to either self-reported diagnosis or MDD symptom criteria) were more likely to endorse each specific depressive symptom, including those that overlap with TBI. Post-TBI depression was highly heterogeneous, with 84–91 % of depressed participants (depending on classification method) showing a unique symptom profile not shared with any other individual. The most common symptom profile was shared by only three individuals. This heterogeneity was meaningful, as specific depressive symptoms had distinct associations with personal, injury-related, treatment, and outcome factors.
Limitations
Cross-sectional design. We only analyzed DSM-5 MDD symptoms, and some symptoms were assessed using only one item.
Conclusions
A symptom-oriented approach to post-TBI depression captures the individual's unique profile of depressive symptoms, which relate differently to outcomes and other factors. We recommend future studies investigating post-TBI depression analyze specific symptoms alongside overall depression scores.}

abstract = {Background
Although suicidal ideation (SI) represents a critical manifestation associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), existing diagnostic methods remain largely subjective. This study adopted resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques to examine objective neural biomarkers connected to SI in patients with MDD.
Methods
Participants comprised 50 patients with MDD and SI (MDD-SI), 56 patients with MDD without SI, and 55 healthy control individuals (HCs), matched by demographic variables. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) analyses were conducted to characterize brain activity patterns. The detected neural features underwent independent clinical correlation and support vector machine (SVM) analyses to evaluate their clinical and diagnostic relevance.
Results
In MDD-SI subjects, elevated fALFF was observed in the middle frontal and right postcentral gyri, with a marginal increase in the left hippocampus. They exhibited unique hyperactivation in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as measured by ReHo, distinguishing them from patients with HCs and MDD without SI. Among individuals in the SI group, left hippocampal fALFF exhibited a significant negative association with depression severity scores (p < 0.05). The SVM classifier reached 63.81 % accuracy in distinguishing MDD-SI individuals from HCs based on ReHo in the right lateral OFC.
Conclusion
The study provides novel evidence for distinct neural substrates underlying SI in MDD, highlighting the involvement of hippocampal-prefrontal circuits and sensory integration regions. Despite limitations related to cross-sectional design and medication effects, the findings enhance the understanding of suicide-related brain changes and may aid in identifying biological markers of suicide risk.}

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) are common conditions associated with disrupted sleep patterns such as insomnia and hypersomnolence. These sleep disorders significantly affect the progression, severity, treatment, and outcome of unipolar and bipolar depression. While there is evidence of a connection between sleep disorders and depression, it remains unclear if sleep features differ between MDD and BD. In light of this, this narrative review aims to: (1) summarize findings on common sleep disorders like insomnia and hypersomnolence, strongly linked to MDD and BD; (2) propose a novel psychometric approach to assess sleep in individuals with depressive disorders. Despite insomnia seems to be more influent in unipolar depression, while hypersomnolence in bipolar one, there is no common agreement. So, it is essential adopting a comprehensive psychometric protocol for try to fill this gap. Understanding the relationship between sleep and MDD and BD disorders are crucial for effective management and better quality of life for those affected.}

Therapy for MDD requires prolonged treatment and often fails, predicating a need for novel treatment strategies. Here, we report increased ceramide levels in the blood plasma of MDD patients and in murine stress-induced models of MDD. These blood plasma ceramide levels correlated with the severity of MDD in human patients and were independent of age, sex, or body mass index. In addition, intravenous injection of anti-ceramide antibodies or neutral ceramidase rapidly abrogated stress-induced MDD, and intravenous injection of blood plasma from mice with MDD induced depression-like behavior in untreated mice, which was abrogated by ex vivo preincubation of the plasma with anti-ceramide antibodies or ceramidase. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that ceramide accumulated in endothelial cells of the hippocampus of stressed mice, evidenced by the quantitative measurement of ceramide in purified hippocampus endothelial cells. We found ceramide inhibited the activity of phospholipase D (PLD) in endothelial cells in vitro and in the hippocampus in vivo and thereby decreased phosphatidic acid in the hippocampus. Finally, we show intravenous injection of PLD or phosphatidic acid abrogated MDD, indicating the significance of this pathway in MDD pathogenesis. Our data indicate that ceramide controls PLD activity and phosphatidic acid formation in hippocampal endothelial cells and thereby mediates MDD. We propose that neutralization of plasma ceramide could represent a rapid-acting targeted treatment for MDD.}

abstract = {Context
Model Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) and low-code/no-code software development tools promise to increase quality and productivity by modelling instead of coding software. One of the major advantages of modelling software is the increased possibility of involving diverse stakeholders since it removes the barrier of being IT experts to actively participate in software production processes. From an academic and industry point of view, the main question remains: What has been proposed to assist humans in software modelling tasks?
Objective
In this paper, we systematically elucidate the state of the art in assistants for software modelling and their use in MDSE and low-code/no-code tools.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping to review the state of the art and answer the following research questions: i) how is software modelling assisted? ii) what goals and limitations do existing modelling assistance proposals report? iii) which evaluation metrics and target users do existing modelling assistance proposals consider? For this purpose, we selected 58 proposals from 3.176 screened records and reviewed 17 MDSE and low-code/no-code tools from main market players published by the Gartner Magic Quadrant.
Result
We clustered existing proposals regarding their modelling assistance strategies, goals, limitations, evaluation metrics, and target users, both in research and practice.
Conclusions
We found that both academic and industry proposals recognise the value of assisting software modelling. However, documentation about MDSE assistants’ limitations, evaluation metrics, and target users is scarce or non-existent. With the advent of artificial intelligence, we expect more assistants for MDSE and low-code/no-code software development will emerge, making imperative the need for well-founded frameworks for designing modelling assistants focused on addressing target users’ needs and advancing the state of the art.}

The complexities of MDD require extensive research of its mechanisms to develop more effective therapeutic approaches. Crucial in the context of this disease is the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway.
Aim
This manuscript aims to explore the complex relationship between MDD and BDNF signaling pathway, focusing on how BDNF is modulated in response to oxidative stress and corticosterone, known to be altered in MDD and contributing to the pathology of the disorder, when treated with scopolamine and mirtazapine.
Methods
To assess BDNF levels after the different treatment conditions, rat hippocampal slices and mice primary hippocampus and cortical cell culture were analyzed by immunofluorescence and Western blot.
Key findings
Both mirtazapine and scopolamine under stress conditions induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and corticosterone, had a significant impact on BDNF levels, and this was distinct in different neuronal models. Mirtazapine, especially when combined with H2O2, altered BDNF expression. Scopolamine when combined with both stressors also altered BDNF levels. However, its effects varied depending on the specific neuronal model and stress condition. In accordance with BDNF results, phosphorylated tropomyosin receptor kinase B (pTrkB) presented increased activation when neuronal cells subjected to stress were treated with mirtazapine or scopolamine.
Significance
Collectively, this study highlights the complex connection between these compounds, stress conditions, and BDNF/TrkB modulation, supporting the potential therapeutic effects of scopolamine and mirtazapine in modulating BDNF levels, even in stressful conditions.}

abstract = {Introduction
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by widespread alterations in brain network organization, but the relationship between temporal dynamics and network connectivity remains poorly understood. We investigated how intrinsic neural timescales (INT), measured through the autocorrelation window (ACW), relate to functional connectivity (FC) in MDD during a disorder-specific task paradigm.
Methods
21 MDD patients, 19 schizophrenia patients (clinical comparison), and 21 healthy controls underwent fMRI scanning during a self-evaluation task. We analyzed temporal dynamics using ACW and examined FC using Network-Based Statistics. The relationship between ACW and FC was assessed using Bayesian modeling.
Results
MDD patients showed significantly reduced ACW compared to controls, with the strongest reductions in Control (β = −0.264), Default Mode (β = −0.203), and Somatomotor (β = −0.177) networks. Network-Based Statistics revealed increased FC in MDD (243 unique connections) particularly within Default and Control networks. MDD patients exhibited a disorder-specific inverse relationship between ACW and FC (β = −0.119) that was absent in controls and contrasted with the positive relationship observed in schizophrenia patients (β = 0.189).
Discussion
Our findings reveal that MDD involves both temporal dysregulation (shortened neural timescales) and spatial disruption (increased connectivity), with a specific alteration in how these properties are coupled. This suggests that MDD might be understood as involving disrupted integration of temporal and spatial brain dynamics, offering novel perspectives for biomarker development and therapeutic interventions targeting temporal processing abnormalities.}

abstract = {Background
Lack of widespread use of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) in clinical practice inhibits measurement of treatment follow-up for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study developed, validated and applied a machine learning model to estimate PHQ-9 scores for MDD patients using relevant notes from electronic medical records (EMR).
Methods
Information from structured and unstructured sections of prescriber notes from a multi-source real-world mental health database were used to estimate PHQ-9 scores (ePHQ-9). Model performance and agreement were evaluated using binary and categorical PHQ-9 outcomes. The final model strategy was applied to MDD patient encounters without scores to assess the extent of added available PHQ-9 measures.
Results
A final model was developed from 48,594 patients and 143,224 clinical encounters with a recorded PHQ-9 score, and then applied to 196,819 MDD patients. Overall model performance was high with an AUC 0.81, PPV 0.71 and NPV 0.76. The addition of ePHQ-9 scores increased the average number of available scores per patient per year by 2.8×.
Limitations
The model was developed using prescribing mental health providers' clinical notes, which limits generalizability to other contexts (e.g., primary care). The PHQ-9 is designed to be patient-reported, whereas this model strategy estimates PHQ-9 scores using clinicians' notes, which results in some expected discrepancies.
Conclusions
This validated ePHQ-9 model contributes to addressing measurement gaps in depression treatment and research by adding substantially to the number of measures available in real-world data for clinical follow-up.}

abstract = {Background
Gamma oscillations play an important role in cognitive processes, including emotional processing in humans. Abnormal gamma oscillations may reflect certain psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). However, less attention has been paid to the role of gamma oscillations in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and their association with the response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).
Methods
A total of 61 TRD patients were recruited for a two-week rTMS treatment consisting of ten sessions. Clinical assessments and eyes-closed resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were conducted before and after treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: prolonged intermittent theta burst stimulation (piTBS), 10-Hz rTMS, or a Sham group. Adaptive nonlinear analysis using Holo–Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA) was applied to extract nonlinear information from the EEG data.
Results
Gamma oscillations were found to be positively correlated with scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17). Additionally, changes in alpha-beta amplitude modulation (AM) modulated gamma oscillations were significantly larger in the Sham group compared to the two active stimulation groups. Furthermore, alpha-beta AM modulated gamma activity was significantly lower in responders compared to non-responders prior to rTMS treatment, irrespective of the specific rTMS protocol.
Conclusions
Gamma oscillations may serve as an electrophysiological marker for the severity of depression in TRD. Additionally, alpha-beta AM could represent a potential predictor of response to rTMS treatment, identifiable prior to the treatment.

A total of 51 children (aged 10–14 years) were categorized into MDD, euthymic BD, and typically developing (TD) controls. Utilizing advanced surface-based morphometry, we examined four cortical features: fractal dimension, gyrification, sulcal depth, and cortical thickness, to delineate disorder-specific and shared neuroanatomical alterations. Additionally, we explored the interaction between white matter volumetrics and these surface-based metrics to assess its modulatory role in structural brain differences. Our results revealed significant cortical alterations, with distinct and overlapping patterns in both MDD and BD. The findings demonstrated disruptions in cortical complexity, folding patterns, and sulcal morphology, particularly in regions implicated in emotion regulation and cognitive processing. These structural variations provide critical insights into the neurodevelopmental alterations associated with pediatric mood disorders. By integrating multiple morphometric parameters, this study offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the neuroanatomical changes in MDD and BD, contributing to more precise diagnostic biomarkers. The results underscore the importance of incorporating surface-based morphometry and white matter interactions in future research to refine early diagnosis and targeted interventions for mood disorders in children.}

The Internet of Things has revolutionized data collection in geosciences through extensive sensor networks. However, developing web-based data warehousing systems for IoT data remains costly and complex. While studies address sensor variability and data ingestion architectures, they often overlook the critical data warehouse component needed to manage IoT data volume and variability. Additionally, Model-Driven Engineering techniques have been used to create dashboards for urban activities but lack advanced map-based visualizations, which are essential for geospatial data.
Objectives:
This study aims to address the challenges of creating IoT data warehouses for geosciences, encouraging scientists to share sensor data analysis results using a simple, user-friendly, and cost-effective approach.
Methods:
The proposed framework integrates (i) a Domain-Specific Language metamodel to define sensors, dimensions, and measurement parameters, (ii) a Software Product Line for IoT data warehouse creation, and (iii) a low-code platform with command-line and web interfaces. The approach was validated through four case studies: meteorological, traffic and air quality, coastal, and oceanic monitoring systems.
Results:
The framework enables efficient IoT data warehouse creation with customized spatial, temporal, and attribute aggregation. Case studies demonstrate adaptability across domains, supporting real-time data ingestion, sensor mobility, and advanced visualization.
Conclusion:
The study presents a scalable, user-friendly framework for IoT data warehousing in geosciences using SPL and DSL technologies, addressing domain-specific challenges and empowering non-expert users. Future work includes usability assessments and expansion to other domains.}

Taking MATLAB/Simulink as a representative of a sophisticated and widely used modeling environment, we extend a multi-language comment taxonomy onto new (visual) comment types and two new languages: Simulink and MATLAB. Furthermore, we outline Simulink commenting practices and compare them to textual languages. We analyze 259,267 comments from 9095 Simulink models and 17,792 MATLAB scripts. We identify the comment types, their usage frequency, classify comment information, and analyze their correlations with model metrics. We manually analyze 757 comments to extend the taxonomy. We also analyze commenting guidelines and developer adherence to them. Our extended taxonomy, SCoT (Simulink Comment Taxonomy), contains 25 categories. We find that Simulink comments, although often duplicated, are used at all model hierarchy levels. Of all comment types, Annotations are used most often; Notes scarcely. Our results indicate that Simulink developers, instead of extending comments, add new ones, and rarely follow commenting guidelines. Overall, we find Simulink comment information comparable to textual languages, which highlights commenting practice similarity across languages.}

Psychological resilience, as a potential protective factor, has been linked to enhanced wellbeing and reduced psychopathology. This study investigated the predictors, associations, and prospective effects of resilience to daily hassles in both short-term (across days) and long-term (across months) contexts.
Methods
Daily resilience was measured through self-reported abilities to cope with daily hassles on a day-to-day basis for 30 days using Experience Sampling Methods in a sample of 86 outpatients diagnosed with depression.
Results
Daily resilience correlated with baseline depression (r = -0.31; p < .001), but not with the five other personal and social resources we investigated. As hypothesized, daily resilience co-varied with daily wellbeing on a day-to-day basis (p = <0.001), was predictive of shifts in wellbeing across days (p = <0.01), and associated with patients’ improvements in depression and dysfunction three months later (B = -0.48 & -0.49; p < .001) and six months later (B = -0.55 & -0.57; p < .001).
Limitations
It should be noted that the study's participants were recruited from a larger Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), and approximately 40% of patients experienced daily hassles. Despite this limitation, the findings suggest that daily resilience may hold promise as a crucial factor to inform intervention strategies and programs aimed at preventing depression relapse.
Conclusion
Daily resilience may well be a promising factor to inform intervention strategies and programmes that aim to prevent (relapse of) depression.}

However, the uneven distribution of medical resources and the complexity of diagnostic methods have resulted in inadequate attention to this disorder in numerous countries and regions.
Methods
This paper introduces a high-performance MDD diagnosis tool named MDD-LLM, an AI-driven framework that utilizes fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) and extensive real-world samples to tackle challenges in MDD diagnosis. Specifically, we select 274,348 individual records from the UK Biobank cohort and design three tabular data transformation methods to create a large corpus for training and evaluating the proposed method. To illustrate the advantages of MDD-LLM, we perform comprehensive experiments and provide several comparative analyses against existing model-based solutions across multiple evaluation metrics.
Results
Experimental results show that MDD-LLM (70B) achieves an accuracy of 0.8378 and an AUC of 0.8919 (95 % CI: 0.8799–0.9040), significantly outperforming existing machine and deep learning frameworks for MDD diagnosis. Given the limited exploration of LLMs in MDD diagnosis, we examine numerous factors that may influence the performance of our proposed method, including tabular data transformation techniques and different fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, we also analyze the model's interpretability, requiring the MDD-LLM to explain its predictions and provide corresponding reasons.
Conclusion
This paper investigates the application of LLMs and large-scale training samples for diagnosing MDD. The findings indicate that LLMs-driven schemes offer significant potential for accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in MDD diagnosis compared to traditional model-based solutions.}

abstract = {Background
Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are psychiatric disorders with overlapping symptoms, leading to high rates of misdiagnosis due to the lack of biomarkers for differentiation. This study aimed to identify metabolic biomarkers in urine samples for diagnosing MDD and BD, as well as to establish unbiased differential diagnostic models.
Methods
We utilized a metabolomics approach employing ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) to analyze the metabolic profiles of urine samples from individuals with MDD (n = 50), BD (n = 12), and healthy controls (n = 50). The identification of urine metabolites was verified using MS data analysis tools and online metabolite databases.
Results
Two diagnostic panels consisting of a combination of metabolites and clinical indicators were identified—one for MDD and another for BD. The discriminative capacity of these panels was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9084 for MDD and an AUC value of 0.9017 for BD.
Conclusions
High-resolution mass spectrometry-based assays show promise in identifying urinary biomarkers for depressive disorders. The combination of urine metabolites and clinical indicators is effective in differentiating healthy controls from individuals with MDD and BD. The metabolic pathway indicating oxidative stress is seen to significantly contribute to depressive disorders.}

Continuous software and system engineering processes, e.g., DevOps, are increasingly adopted and spread across organizations. In parallel, many leading companies have begun to apply artificial intelligence (AI) principles and techniques, including Machine Learning (ML), to improve their products. However, there is no holistic approach that can support and enhance the growing challenges of DevOps. In this paper, we propose a software architecture that provides the foundations of a model-based framework for the development of AI-augmented solutions incorporating methods and tools for continuous software and system engineering and validation. The key characteristic of the proposed architecture is that it allows leveraging the advantages of both AI/ML and Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches and techniques in a DevOps context. This architecture has been designed, developed and applied in the context of the European large collaborative project named AIDOaRt. In this paper, we also report on the practical evaluation of this architecture. This evaluation is based on a significant set of technical solutions implemented and applied in the context of different real industrial case studies coming from the AIDOaRt project. Moreover, we analyze the collected results and discuss them according to both architectural and technical challenges we intend to tackle with the proposed architecture.}

We repeated the procedure after swapping the roles of the two datasets to identify superior pipelines, regardless of the discovery dataset. The classification results of the top 10 biomarkers showed high similarity, and weight similarity was observed between eight of the biomarkers, except for two that used both data-driven parcellation and FC computation.

abstract = {Background
Major depressive disorder is identified as a mood disorder characterized by episodically recurring and potentially life-threatening negative symptoms. It is currently important for study, as it involves high morbidity, mortality and prevalence, as well as unsatisfactory treatment results.
Aim
Establish an outpatient model from an integrative approach promoting the diversified development of traditional Chinese and Western medicine cooperation, leading to a holistic intervention for patients with depression.
Experimental procedure
Fifteen participants with moderate to severe depression were followed up for eight weeks in the Acupuncture Department of the China Medical University Hospital in Taichung, Taiwan, under a collaborative outpatient model that combined Western psychiatry and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Interdisciplinary Intervention included manual acupuncture twice a week (16 sessions), tai chi, yoga meditation, and nutritional assessment. Symptomatology was measured with primary outcomes (self-reporting via questionnaires) and secondary outcomes (heart rate variability [HRV] and blood samples to measure inflammation via high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]).
Results
The response rate was 80% (12/15 participants), with a statistically and clinically significant decrease in depression severity according to the 21-question Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS21) (p < 0.001), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (p < 0.003), and quality of life (QoL) questionnaires (p < 0.002). We found body constitution heterogeneity in the participants with major depressive disorder (MDD), predominantly blood stagnation and Qi stagnation (in 70% of participants).
Conclusion
An interdisciplinary outpatient treatment method of complementary therapies can be applied successfully with pharmacological treatment in clinical practice to reduce depression symptomatology.

abstract = {Background
Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is considered when an individual fails to respond to two or more different antidepressants in adequate doses, duration and with adequate adherence within the same major depressive episode.
Aim
To examine the clinical profiles of TRD patients through data from electronic healthcare records and compare characteristics and treatment pathways of ethnic minority and non-minority patients in UK.
Methods
A retrospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study of patients with TRD was carried out in 10 Mental Health NHS Foundation Trusts in the Akrivia Health/UK Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system network. The CRIS system was used as a means of analysing de-identified data across 3.2 million anonymised patients' records.
Results
10,048 patient records were deemed eligible for this study, of which 20.2 % of patients identified as BAME, and 79.8 % patients identified as White. Overall, around half of the patients were likely to be prescribed an antidepressant within 2 months of the MDD diagnosis. White patients were prescribed more antidepressants than the BAME group (p < 0.001), with a significant effect size for comorbidities.
Limitations
The nature of the data source limited the ability to filter for short treatment durations as clinicians did not often record concrete medication end-dates in clinical note fields.
Conclusion
There are significant differences in care pathways between ethnic groups in relation to TRD patients. It is vital to understand factors causing these potential clinical biases and increase awareness and education to deliver the most effective treatments for TRD in ethnic minority patients.}

Major depressive disorder (MDD) presents significant public health challenges due to its increasing prevalence and complex risk factors. This study systematically analyzed data from 2019 to 2023 to explore trends in MDD incidence, symptom progression, and multidimensional influencing factors.
Objective
The study aimed to identify key risk factors and mechanisms of MDD progression through multidimensional variable analysis and machine learning model evaluation, optimizing predictive models to provide a scientific basis for early screening, targeted interventions, and public health policy formulation.
Methods
Data from the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were analyzed using LASSO regression for feature selection and various machine learning models (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Gaussian NB, Extra Trees) for risk prediction. SHAP value analysis was employed to interpret the models and identify key predictors across psychological, social, and biological domains.
Results
Depression risk was closely associated with psychological health (e.g., PHQ82, ANXLEVEL), social support (e.g., DISCRIM1, PCNTADLT), and biological health (e.g., COGMEMDFF, DEPEV). AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Gaussian NB, and Extra Trees demonstrated superior performance in different tasks, with SHAP analysis highlighting the critical role of psychological health in risk prediction and the importance of social support and cognitive deficits in symptom progression.
Conclusions
This study provides a scientific foundation for early screening of MDD, personalized intervention strategies, and public health policy optimization. Future research should expand data coverage, optimize models, and incorporate causal inference methods to enhance the precision and applicability of depression risk prediction.}

Cognitive Reserve (CR) has been proposed as a protective factor against cognitive decline and functional impairment in psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder (BD). However, how CR differs between BD, other psychiatric populations, and healthy individuals remains unclear.
Objective
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate differences in CR between individuals with BD, healthy controls (HCs), at-risk populations, and patients with other psychiatric disorders.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for studies assessing CR in BD and control populations, using validated CR measures or proxies (e.g., education, intelligence quotient, occupational status, leisure activities). A multilevel random-effects meta-analysis was performed to compare CR levels between BD and HCs, and BD and other psychiatric disorders.
Results
Twelve studies (N = 1861 participants) met inclusion criteria. Meta-analytic findings revealed that individuals with BD exhibited significantly lower CR than HCs (SMD = -0.45, 95 % CI: -0.69 to -0.20, I² = 84.5 %), whereas no significant differences emerged between BD and MDD (SMD = -0.23, 95 % CI: -0.49 to 0.03, I² = 41.7 %). Sociodemographic and clinical variables did not significantly moderate CR levels.
Conclusion
CR is lower in BD compared to HCs, suggesting its contribution to cognitive and functional impairments. Conversely, similar CR between BD and MDD highlight shared clinical vulnerabilities. These results underscore the need for targeted interventions to enhance CR in patients with BD. Future research should prioritize standardized CR assessment and investigate modifiable factors contributing to CR development in psychiatric populations.}

In this regard, traditional gradient/Hessian-based methods often get trapped in saddle points or local minima, making them unsuitable for complex tensegrities. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while effective at global optimization, can be computationally expensive. Conventional two-step form-finding approaches first use singular value decomposition (SVD) to extract independent self-stress states to further determine the global tensegrity configuration. However, for multi-cell tensegrities, the increased number of members and shared components lead to coupled self-stress states, rendering SVD-based approaches impractical and necessitating an alternative optimization-driven approach. To address these limitations of existing approaches, this study proposes a hybrid form-finding method combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) with modified Differential Evolution (mDE). By integrating GA’s global search with DE’s advanced mutation and self-adaptive crossover, the approach enhances efficiency while reducing computational costs. Unlike conventional methods, it eliminates the need for SVD and bypasses the iterative selection of self-stress states, inherently ensuring stability constraints and applicability for multi-cell tensegrities. The methodology is validated on various tensegrity configurations, demonstrating its ability to efficiently generate stable, self-equilibrated structures. This novel approach is perceived to offer a scalable and computationally viable solution for tensegrity design, overcoming key limitations of existing methods.}

abstract = {Background
Music can directly influence emotions, the regulation of which are known to be impaired in major depressive disorder (MDD). While music therapy (MT) could be an effective complement to treat MDD, studies investigating such effects have not yet yielded conclusive results. We hypothesized that group music therapy (GMT) might lead to a significant reduction of depressive symptoms (DS).
Methods
In a randomized controlled trial, 102 women with current MDD were randomly assigned to an intervention group receiving GMT or a waitlist control group. Data assessment was conducted pre- (T0), post- (T1), and at a 10-week follow-up to (T2) the intervention. DS as the primary outcome were assessed via observer-rated (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, T0–T1), self-rated (Beck Depression Inventory, T0–T1–T2), and ecological momentary (T0–T1) assessments. Secondary effects on emotion and mood regulation strategies, and quality of life (QoL), were measured T0–T1–T2.
Results
The results suggest non-significant effects of the GMT on a descriptive level on self-reported and observer rated DS and statistically significant effects on DS in everyday life, QoL, and regulation strategies, with larger effects from T0–T1 than from T0–T1–T2.
Limitations
The generalizability is limited by the high dropout rate and data loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the fact that long-term effects of GMT are not assured, and the homogeneous gender (female) of the sample.
Conclusions
GMT is an economical approach to treat MDD, yielding health-promoting effects regarding DS, emotion regulation, and QoL. Manualization and further evaluation of MT is strongly recommended.}

Gastrodiae Rhizoma (GR) and its extract have been widely used in the treatment of depression, but the underlying mechanism of its antidepressant effects is unclear due to its numerous components.
Purpose
Revealing the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of GR through a comprehensive pharmacology-based in vivo and in vitro investigation.
Methods
A mouse model of depression was established using chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure, and the antidepressant effects of GR were evaluated using systematic behavior. Metabolites in GR decoction and in mouse brain were identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS technology. Core components and targets of GR against MDD were screened based on network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking. The mechanism through which GR mitigated MDD was explored using transcriptome analysis, immunohistochemistry and western blotting in vitro and in vivo.
Results
A total of 273 components were identified in the GR decoction, out of which 15 were detected in the brain of depressed mice treated with the GR decoction. We further identified nine key active ingredients, six essential targets, and fifth signaling pathways associated with the therapeutic effects of GR against MDD. We confirmed that the active ingredients of GR can target the neural stem/precursor cells (NSPCs) in the hippocampus of depressed mice to promote neurogenesis, as evidenced by a significant increase in the numbers of DCX+ cells, BrdU+ cells, BrdU+-DCX+ cells, and BrdU+-NeuN+ cells within the hippocampus of GR-treated mice compared to salinetreated mice under CMS exposure. Moreover, we have identified that the key active constituents of GR, namely gastrodin and parishin C, exert a targeted effect on EGFR to activate PI3K-Akt signaling in NSPCs, thereby facilitating proliferation and differentiation of NSPCs.
Conclusion
The antidepressant effect of GR involves the facilitation of PI3K/Akt-mediated neurogenesis through gastrodin and parishin C targeting EGFR in NSPCs.}

Moreover, current frameworks are efficient only when designing simple chatbot applications while they still require advanced technical knowledge to define complex interactions and are difficult to evolve along with the company needs. In addition, the deployment of a chatbot application usually requires a deep understanding of the targeted platforms, especially back-end connections, increasing the development and maintenance costs. In this paper, we discuss our experiences building, evolving and distributing the Xatkit framework. Xatkit is a model-based framework built around a Domain-Specific Language to define chatbots (and voicebots and bots in general) in a platform-independent way. Xatkit also comes with a runtime engine that automatically deploys the chatbot application and manages the defined conversation logic over the platforms of choice. Xatkit has significantly evolved since its initial release. This paper focuses on describing the evolution and the reasons (technical and non-technical) that triggered them.

abstract = {Background
While theta burst stimulation (TBS) shows promise in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), its effectiveness in bipolar depression (BD-D) remains uncertain. Optimizing treatment parameters is crucial in the pursuit of rapid symptom relief. Moreover, aligning with personalized treatment strategies and increased interest in immunopsychiatry, biomarker-based stratification of patients most likely to benefit from TBS might improve remission rates. We investigated treatment effectiveness of continuous TBS (cTBS) compared to sham in BD-D, and assessed the capacity of plasma kynurenine pathway metabolites to predict treatment outcome.
Methods
Thirty-seven patients with BD-D underwent accelerated active or sham cTBS treatment in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Depressive symptoms were measured with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) before treatment (T0), 3–4 days posttreatment (T1) and 10–11 days posttreatment (T2). Plasma tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid concentrations were quantified with ELISA. Linear mixed models were used for statistical analyses.
Results
Although the total sample showed depressive symptom improvement, active cTBS did not demonstrate greater symptom alleviation compared to sham. However, higher baseline quinolinic acid significantly predicted symptom improvement in the active treatment group, not in sham-stimulated patients.
Limitations
The modest sample size limited the power to detect significant differences with regard to treatment effect. Also, the follow-up period was 10–11 days, whereas similar studies usually follow up for at least one month.
Conclusion
More research is required to optimize cTBS for BD-D and explore the involvement of quinolinic acid in treatment outcome.}

abstract = {Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) represents a major clinical challenge. Affecting about 30 % of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients, effective treatments for TRD are urgently needed. While depression research and antidepressant (AD) development have long centred on monoaminergic targets, research over the past 35 years has increasingly explored glutamatergic mechanisms. Here we present an extended discussion on developments in glutamatergic drug discovery, focusing on mechanistic convergence between NMDA and AMPA receptor signalling. Beyond established rapid-acting antidepressants (RAADs), such as (es)ketamine and dextromethorphan/bupropion (AXS-05), we highlight novel therapeutic directions involving esmethadone (REL-1017), nitrous oxide, and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of NMDA receptors (e.g. rapastinel, zelquistinel, and apimostinel). Moreover, we discuss forward-looking strategies using AMPA receptor PAMs (e.g. osavampator and tulrampator) and targeting of AMPA receptor-interacting proteins. By integrating recent clinical evidence with molecular and physiological findings, we highlight a convergent mechanism across these compounds. This involves increased AMPA receptor activation, triggering BDNF release and mTOR signalling, promoting synaptic strengthening through enhanced AMPA receptor trafficking and dendritic spine formation. Together, targeting glutamatergic signalling represents a transformative path for TRD treatment with high efficacy by more directly modulating pathologically affected signalling modules. These developments place glutamatergic agents at the forefront of next-generation AD strategies.}

abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading neuropsychiatric condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Epigenetic mechanisms are key factors involved in the development of MDD, with microRNAs (miRNAs) serving as important epigenetic regulators in this process. Increasing evidence suggests that approximately 70 % of miRNA is expressed in the brain, playing a crucial role in various brain functions. Aberrant changes in miRNA expression are frequently associated with the pathophysiology of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, including MDD. One notable stress-responsive miRNA is miR-128, which is highly expressed in the brain and involved in numerous functions, such as neural development, signaling pathways, neuronal migration, neural plasticity, and neurogenesis. The significant role of this miRNA positions it as a critical candidate for increased susceptibility to stress. So far, the role of miR-128 has been reported in various neurodegenerative disorders; however, studies examining its involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders are gaining traction. More specifically, miR-128 has been shown to influence the Wnt signaling pathway, potentially leading to depression-like behavior. In this review, we critically evaluate the functions of miR-128, with a particular focus on its regulatory mechanisms, target gene expression, and downstream signaling pathways. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive assessment of miR-128–3p regarding its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of MDD and its possible role as a disease and treatment biomarker. This exploration may unveil new avenues for innovative diagnostic approaches and treatment strategies in MDD.}

Fecal samples from 50 hospitalized patients with MDD, including 35 with recent suicide attempts (60 % female) and 15 without a history of suicide (73 % female), were analyzed using 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing to assess microbiome diversity and metabolic potential. Results revealed that suicide attempters exhibited significantly greater microbial richness and distinct beta-diversity patterns. Notably, they had higher levels of Fenollaria timonensis and lower levels of Corynebacterium aurimucosum. Additionally, 25 metabolic pathways differed between groups, with several linked to energy metabolism and amino acid processing—processes previously associated with MDD and suicidal behavior. These findings suggest that microbiome composition may influence suicide risk through gut-brain axis-mediated pathways, although due to the exploratory nature of this study further investigation is needed to validate our findings. Given the microbiome's modifiability, future research should explore microbial-targeted interventions as a potential strategy for suicide prevention in individuals with MDD.}

abstract = {Background
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) treatment remains challenging. This N-of-1 study evaluated a personalized integrative homeopathic protocol for MDD. Methods: A 28-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial assessed Sulphur fifty-millesimal potencies (LM4–7) effectiveness and safety in a 45-year-old female with MDD. The primary outcomes were Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores, and secondary outcomes included SF-12 and Clinical Global Impression Scale scores. We conducted Plasma proteomics and physicochemical analyses (SEM, DLS, ICP-MS) of Sulphur LM2–7.
Results
BDI-II scores increased significantly in the placebo group (P = 0.017), whereas no significant change was observed in the Sulphur-treated group (P = 0.243). Overall symptom improvement with homeopathy compared to placebo, controlling for baseline, was 78 % (p < 0.05). MCS-12 significantly decreased during placebo (P = 0.008) but remained stable during homeopathic treatment (P = 0.542). No significant PCS-12 changes were observed (P > 0.2). CGI-I scores improved during the run-in treatment but showed no further change during the N-of-1 trial. Sulfur-loaded LM formulations presented nanoparticles, as confirmed by SEM analysis, demonstrated distinct particle size characteristics via DLS, and exhibited quantifiable sulfur concentrations detected through ICP-MS. Proteomic analysis suggested that Sulphur treatment modulates immune response pathways, highlighting a potential mechanism underlying its antidepressant-like effects.
Conclusions
This personalized integrative homeopathic protocol demonstrated superior effectiveness to placebo in the studied individual. The physicochemical characteristics and proteomic findings indicate potential immunomodulatory effects mediated by nanomedicine mechanisms. However, further research involving larger cohorts is warranted to confirm these preliminary observations.}

Here, we review studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with self-based tasks in major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders (AD) to determine the transdiagnostic and differential-diagnostic applicability of neural markers related to the self. This systematic review identified three main findings: (I) Large-scale brain-wide changes related to self-dysfunction overlap significantly between MDD and AD. (II) Regional changes are unspecific to tasks and stimuli confirming their specificity to the self as distinguished from other cognitive functions. (III) MDD affects regions related to emotional-cognitive processing like the anterior cingulate cortex, while AD involves prefrontal and insular regions associated with interoceptive and emotional-cognitive regulation. Our systematic review shows the utility of the self as a transdiagnostic marker that exhibits neural topographic similarities across the diagnostic boundaries of MDD and AD. More fine-grained regional differences between MDD and AD can be found within their underlying large scale neural similarities, allowing for their differential-diagnostic specification. In conclusion, we demonstrate the relevance of the self as both a transdiagnostic and differential diagnostic neural marker in MDD and AD.}

However, due to the diversity, complexity, and region-specific nature of SSCS, the need for individualized development often arises, leading to time-consuming and error-prone in SSCS development. To address this challenge, we introduce ERC-Code, an automated development framework that empowers developers to prioritize design over implementation. ERC-Code includes extended reactive component modeling, correctness specifications, and model-to-code transformations. The extended reactive component offers the advantage of capturing the complex logic of SSCS at a high level of abstraction, including loops, branches and synchronizations. The correctness specifications prevent the creation of incomplete and invalid models, ensuring the robustness of the generated code. Additionally, the model-to-code engine automatically generates code from the extended reactive component. Our evaluation covers three key aspects: firstly, we assessed the effectiveness of ERC-Code in three real-world SSCS applications. We then conducted a comparison between the traces generated by ERC-Code and the ERC model. Finally, we conducted an experiment to evaluate developer productivity, drawing comparisons between ERC-Code and a code-centric approach. Our results exhibit promise, affirming ERC-Code’s applicability and code quality, along with enhanced productivity.}

Current methods typically integrate multimodal information within samples to distinguish positive from negative samples, but they often neglect the relationships between samples. Despite similarities within the same class, individual variations exist. By leveraging these relationships, we can provide supervision signals for both inter- and intra-class samples, thereby enhancing the discriminative power of user representations. Inspired by this observation, we introduce IISFD, a novel approach that concurrently exploits intra-sample contrastive learning and inter-sample contrastive learning with hard negative sampling. This method comprehensively considers information both within individual samples and across samples. Specifically, we decompose the multimodal inputs of each sample, including audio, vision and text, into modality-common features and modality-specific features. To obtain better decomposed feature representations, we integrate intra-sample contrastive learning and inter-sample contrastive learning with hard negative sampling. Additionally, detailed modal information is obtained through unimodal reconstruction. By passing the decomposed features through a carefully designed multimodal fusion module, we obtain more discriminative user representations. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model, highlighting its effectiveness in leveraging both intra- and inter-sample information for enhanced MDD.}

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions and has a tremendous impact on those affected. Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) technology has high potential to improve psychotherapy for MDD, as VR can personalize the treatment process and directly influence affect. Research on VR interventions for MDD is emerging, but current applications for treatment are heterogeneous and lack strong theoretical support. This scoping review aims to identify the therapeutic strategies that should and can be targeted in VR interventions for depression.
Methods
A systematic search of the literature was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, Ovid Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Clinical Trials Register, and the ‘Dutch Trial Register’ from inception through November 2023 to identify the most relevant research.
Results
Findings from 43 studies included in this review resulted in the following potential therapeutic strategies: 1) psychoeducation (n=5), 2) behavioral activation (n=16), 3) cognitive restructuring (n=4), 4) enhancing positive affect (n=5), 5) mental imagery (n=4), 6) skills training (n=3), 7) enhancing cognitive functioning (n=3), and 8) other (n=3).
Limitations
We did not conduct a systematic assessment of the methodological quality of the studies nor perform a statistical analysis of the results.
Conclusions
VR shows potential to facilitate the treatment process for patients with depression in different ways, providing excellent prospects for personalizing and potentially improving the treatment of MDD. Future studies should focus on evaluating presumed mechanisms of change to fully understand the added value of VR in the treatment of depression.}

This seasonal vulnerability may involve specific chronobiological and sleep regulation disturbances, however, actigraphy and polysomnography studies reported conflicting and inconclusive findings. In this context, we hypothesized that individuals with MDE who exhibit higher vulnerability to seasonal changes display distinct chronobiological and sleep regulation disturbances. We investigated how sleep and circadian rhythms, assessed through subjective markers (N = 254) and objective actigraphic (N = 96) and polysomnographic markers (N = 54)—varied in individuals with MDE according to their vulnerability to seasonal changes. To conduct this dimensional approach, that may be closer to the pathophysiology, we assessed the seasonal vulnerability using the Global Seasonality Score (GSS) from the Seasonal Patterns Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ). The results revealed that greater seasonal vulnerability was correlated to increased excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth scale), (r = 0.218, p < 0.001), shorter REM sleep latency (r = -0.381, p = 0.005), (even when controlling for age using the Kupfer index (r = -0.452, p < 0.001)), and shorter N1 sleep latency (r = -0.411, p = 0.002). The regression model retained only the polysomnographic markers—N1 sleep latency, REM sleep latency, Kupfer Index—independently and significantly associated to the GSS. This study confirms a link between seasonal vulnerability and shortened REM sleep latency, emphasizing that light and the photoperiod play a pivotal role in regulating the systems involved in REM sleep dysregulation in depressive disorders.}

Anhedonia is a hallmark symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), associated with impairments in various aspects of reward. VIVRE is the first study in patients with MDD receiving antidepressant therapy to include longitudinal assessment of reward behavior using the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), a validated behavioral paradigm for the objective assessment of reward and effort-based decision-making in patients with MDD.
Methods
Randomized, double-blind study of vortioxetine (10 or 20 mg/day) versus desvenlafaxine (50 mg/day) in adults with MDD and partial response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy. Motivation for reward based on the proportion of hard trial choices was assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment.
Results
There was no difference in the proportion of hard trial choices between the vortioxetine (n = 288) and desvenlafaxine (n = 300) treatment groups at baseline. Minimal change in parameters of reward motivation was seen over the 8-week treatment period in either group. The between-group difference in the proportion of hard trial choices at week 8 was not statistically significant (odds ratio: 0.97 [95 % CI: 0.82, 1.14]; P = 0.72). Similar results were obtained when controlling for reward probability, reward magnitude, trial number, and sex, or when limiting to the first 50 trials (excluding computer-selected trials).
Limitations
Exploratory analyses evaluating the utility of the EEfRT in clinical populations.
Conclusions
Experience from the VIVRE study suggests that further research is required to fully determine the clinical utility of the EEfRT for assessment of antidepressant treatment effects in patients with MDD.

abstract = {Background
The brain of major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with altered functional connectivity (FC) compared to that of healthy individuals when processing positive and negative visual stimuli. Building upon alterations in brain connectivity, some researchers have employed electroencephalography (EEG) to study FC in MDD, aiming to enhance both diagnosis and treatment; however, the results have been inconsistent and the studies involving FC during emotional recognition are limited. This study aims to 1) investigate the effects of MDD on EEG patterns during visual emotional processing, 2) explore the therapeutic effects of antidepressant treatment on brain FC within the first week, and assess whether these effects can be predictive of treatment outcomes four weeks later, and 3) study baseline FC parameter biomarkers that can be used to predict treatment responsiveness in MDD patients.
Methods
This clinical observational study recruited 38 healthy controls (HC) and 48 MDD patients. Patients underwent an EEG exam while looking at validated images of happy and sad faces at week 0 and 1. MDD patients were categorized into treatment responders and non-responders after 4 weeks of treatment. We conducted the FC analysis (node strength (NS), global efficiency (GE), and cluster coefficient (CC)) on HC and MDD patients using graph theoretical analysis. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the influence of MDD on FC compared to HC, while controlling for confounding variables including age, gender, and academic degrees.
Results
At week 0 and week 1, MDD patients revealed to have significant reductions in FC parameters (NS, GE and CC) compared to HC. When comparing MDD patients at week 1 post-antidepressant treatment and pre-treatment, no significant differences in FC changes were observed. Multivariable regression revealed a significant negative effect on FC of MDD. Compared to the treatment non-responsive group, the responsive group revealed a significantly higher FC in delta band frequency at baseline.
Conclusions
MDD patient group showed impaired FC during visual emotion-processing and we observed baseline FC parameters to be associated with treatment response at week 4. While signs of FC changes were observed in the brain after a week of treatment, it is possible that one week may still be insufficient to demonstrate significant alterations in the brain. Our results suggest the potential utilization of EEG-based FC as an indicative measure for predicting treatment response and monitoring treatment progress in MDD patients.}

Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) have shown alterations of processes underlying response inhibition, which is the cognitive process that permits the suppression of habitual or natural behavioural responses to stimuli to select a more appropriate response that is coherent with the goal; these alterations have been correlated with cognitive deficits, especially in older adults. Electrophysiological (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have investigated the neuronal and hemodynamic process underlying inhibition through tasks measuring the ability to suppress a dominant response when non-target stimuli are shown and reported differences between healthy controls (HCs) and MDD subjects. However, these were unimodal studies that provided an incomplete picture of the phenomenon, due to the single technique sensitivity and limited by the characteristics of each technique itself. In this study, we performed an EEG-driven fMRI analysis to explore the different hemodynamic correlates of specific event-related potentials (ERPs) of inhibitory control in late-onset MDD during a visuomotor Go/No-Go task. The dataset was composed of 18 older adult HCs and 18 late-onset MDD patients. Behavioral analysis showed higher response time to target stimuli in inhibitory blocks and lower percentage of correct answers for target stimuli in MDD compared to HCs. ERP analysis revealed the inhibitory effect for both N2 and P3 in both groups. Moreover, EEG-driven fMRI analysis showed alterations in the MDD group in the superior temporal gyrus and cerebellar areas for N2 correlates, whereas in the supramarginal, left rolandic, and Heschl’s areas for P3 correlates. The study showed the potentiality of the EEG-fMRI integration for investigating complex cognitive processes. Specifically, the EEG-driven fMRI analyses showed different correlates for separate cognitive processing steps, N2 and P3, highlighting differences between MDD and HC.}

abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a worldwide concern owing to its negative impact on the quality of life. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an essential neurotransmitter in the brain, is important for regulating the enteric nervous system and gut-brain dual communication (gut-brain axis), thus providing gastrointestinal GABA and GABA-related pathways with possible targets for MDD treatment. However, the use of GABA for this disease remains limited due to its poor pharmacokinetic properties, including the low permeability through the blood-brain barrier, and the rapid clearance from the gastrointestinal tract. Since poly(amino acid)s are advantageous for improving the beneficial bioactivities of conventional amino acids, poly(gamma-aminobutyric acid) (poly(GABA)) is a potential candidate for MDD therapy. Nevertheless, the non-water-soluble and non-dispersible characteristics of poly(GABA) render difficulty in administering its conventional forms in vitro/in vivo, thereby hindering its therapeutic applications. Therefore, this study proposes a new design for poly(GABA) in nanoparticle form, which is composed of the amphiphilic diblock copolymers of poly(GABA) and poly(ethylene glycol), providing a suitable formulation for medication applications. Herein, we report on a new orally deliverable poly(GABA)-based nanoparticles (NanoGABA) in aqueous media and their efficacy on mouse depression models. NanoGABA treatment efficiently attenuated depression-like symptoms as evidenced by behavioral tests (forced swimming tests and tail suspension tests) and stress biomarkers (corticosterone). These findings suggest that the newly designed poly(GABA)-based nanoparticles are a promising candidate for the treatment of depression.
Statement of significance
This research is the first to report the preparation of poly(GABA)-based nanoparticles in aqueous conditions with beneficial physical properties to open the gate for medical and pharmaceutical applications of poly (GABA). It is also a pioneer in using poly(GABA)-based materials for major depressive disorder therapeutics in vivo. Oral administration of NanoGABA attenuates depressive-like symptoms by targeting the enteric nervous system possibly through modulation of the gut-brain axis pathways with negligible toxicity, suggesting that NanoGABA is a promising therapeutic agent for major depressive disorders.}

abstract = {Background
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and its abbreviated versions, the PHQ-8 and the PHQ-2, are frequently used as online depression screeners. Their accuracy to detect major depressive disorder (MDD) has been examined in only a limited number of studies in student samples.
Objective
Assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of PHQ-9, PHQ-8 and PHQ-2 to detect MDD.
Methods
A general online population sample was recruited through traditional and social media campaigns, print advertisement in public areas of several German cities and via a nationwide online access survey panel. Participants, aged 18 years or above, completed the PHQ-9 online and were assessed for MDD via telephone using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values, and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated in a cross-sectional design to assess diagnostic accuracy.
Results
In total, n = 790 participants (574 (72.7 %) female, age: 37.4 (SD = 13.9; range: 18–79)) were screened with the PHQ-9 (mean = 11.1; SD = 5.4) and interviewed via telephone using the SCID (41.2 % fulfilling the criterion of MDD). The optimal cut-off was 11 points for the PHQ-9 (sensitivity: 0.77; specificity: 0.68; AUC: 0.80; NPV: 0.81; PPV: 0.63), 11 points for the PHQ-8 (sensitivity: 0.74; specificity: 0.71; AUC: 0.79; NPV: 0.79; PPV: 0.64) and 3 points for the PHQ-2 (sensitivity: 0.68; specificity: 0.74; AUC: 0.76; NPV: 0.77; PPV: 0.65). Descriptively, age or gender had limited impact on diagnostic accuracy.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the online version of the PHQ-9, PHQ-8, and PHQ-2 show moderate to good diagnostic accuracy to detect MDD. Still, screening results should be interpreted with caution as a number of cases are likely to be either missed or incorrectly identified.}

To maintain synchronization between models and code/documents — which can evolve independently — this paper introduces BIT, a bidirectional language that can serve as a conventional template language for model-to-text transformations. However, a BIT program can function as both a printer, generating text by filling template holes with values from the input model, and a parser, putting parsed values back into the model. BIT comprises a surface language for better usability and a core language for formal definition. We define the semantics of the core language based on the theory of bidirectional transformation, and provide the translation from the surface to the core. We present the proof sketch of the well behavedness of BIT as a formal evidence of soundness. We also conduct three case studies to empirically demonstrate the expressiveness and the effectiveness of BIT. Based on the proof and the case studies, BIT covers the major features of existing template languages, and offers sufficient expressiveness to define real-world model-to-text transformations that can be executed bidirectionally and incrementally.}

With the increasing accumulation of multimodal MRI data in recent years, integrating information from various modalities has become an effective strategy for improving the detection of brain disorders. This study focuses on identifying major depressive disorder (MDD) by using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI in conjunction with structural MRI data. We collected ASL and structural MRI data from 260 participants, including 169 MDD patients and 91 healthy controls. We developed an explainable fusion method to identify MDD, utilizing cerebral blood flow (CBF) data from ASL perfusion MRI and brain tissue volumes from structural MRI. The fusion model, which integrates multimodal data, demonstrated superior predictive performance for MDD. By combining MRI regional volumes with CBF data, we achieved more effective results than using each modality independently. Additionally, we analyzed feature importance and interactions to explain the fusion model. We identified fourteen important features, comprising eight regional volumes and six regional CBF measures, that played a crucial role in the identification of MDD. Furthermore, we found three feature interactions among the important features and seven interactions between structural and functional features, which were particularly prominent in the model. The results of this study suggest that the fusion learning approach, which integrates ASL and structural MRI data, is effective in detecting MDD. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the model explanation method can reveal key features that influence the decisions of models, as well as potential interactions among these key features or between functional and structural features in identifying MDD.}

abstract = {Background
Population-based surveys suggest that low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with higher prevalence of depressive symptoms, while their healthcare utilization is not necessarily higher.
Objective
To investigate the association between neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES) and healthcare utilization among individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD).
Method
This was a retrospective longitudinal study of all adults with a first MDD diagnosis within primary care during 2010–2018. NSES was defined by the household area of residence using the Mosaic™ classification. Outcomes were AD (antidepressants) (N06A) dispensation and psychiatric outpatient visit, both of which are outlined as options in depression guidelines. Cox multivariable regression was used for the time to event analyses.
Results
A total of 117,193 individuals were included, of which 87,499 (75 %) were dispensed an AD and 35,989 (31 %) had a recorded psychiatric outpatient visit. Low NSES was associated with lower rate of AD dispensation in the first-year post-diagnosis (HR: 0.95, 95 % CI: 0.93–0.96, p < 0.001) and higher rate of psychiatric visit (HR: 1.10, 95 % CI: 1.07–1.12, p < 0.001) compared with high NSES.
Limitations
Data sources have high coverage. A minority of psychiatric care provided by non-publicly financed providers was not included. It was not possible to adjust for depression severity.
Conclusion
Socioeconomic status as measured by the neighborhood of residency was associated with AD dispensation and psychiatric outpatient visit in MDD, also in a healthcare system with virtually free access. This is of relevance for clinical practice, considering the focus on equity of care and the increase in depression prevalence worldwide.}

abstract = {Background
Major depressive disorder (MDD) comes along with an increased risk of recurrence and poor course of illness. Machine learning has recently shown promise in the prediction of mental illness, yet models aiming to predict MDD course are still rare and do not quantify the predictive value of established MDD recurrence risk factors.
Methods
We analyzed N = 571 MDD patients from the Marburg-Münster Affective Disorder Cohort Study (MACS). Using random forest classifiers, we predicted i) recurrence of depressive episodes and ii) MDD disease trajectories, within a 2-year interval. Trajectories were identified through latent profile analysis, using a discovery and an internal validation sample. Three distinct models were implemented for predictions: two incorporating only literature-derived MDD recurrence risk factors, and a third incorporating a broader set of explorative features.
Results
Basing predictions on only seven recurrence risk factors, MDD recurrence could be predicted with a balanced accuracy (BACC) of 62.83 % and MDD trajectories were predicted with highest performance achieved for a remitted (BACC = 64.23 %) and a severe MDD trajectory (BACC = 63.17 %). Risk factors included childhood maltreatment, previous depressive episodes, residual symptoms, comorbid anxiety, age of onset, depression severity, and neuroticism. Including a broader feature set only yielded in minor increase of predictive performance.
Limitations
Lacking external validation, generalizability to other samples remains uncertain.
Conclusions
MDD recurrence and disease trajectories can be predicted based on literature-derived recurrence risk factors. Model performance must increase to be of use in clinical practice which could be achieved by including multimodal risk factors.}

Isoform-specific expression patterns have been linked to stress-related psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). To further explore their involvement, we constructed co-expression networks using total gene expression (TE) and isoform ratio (IR) data from affected (n = 210, 81% with depressive symptoms) and unaffected (n = 95) individuals. Networks were validated using advanced graph generation methods. Our analysis revealed distinct differences in network topology and structure. Shared hubs exhibited unique co-regulatory patterns in each network, with key master hubs in the affected network showing association with psychiatric disorders. Gene Ontology enrichment highlighted condition-specific biological processes linked to each network’s master hubs. Notably, isoform-level data uncovered unique co-regulatory interactions and enrichments not observed at the gene level. This is the first study to show network-level differences of gene and isoform co-expression between affected and unaffected individuals of stress-related psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the importance of isoforms in understanding the molecular mechanisms of these conditions.}

Expanding on previous research linking MED22 to CT in MDD, we examined three research questions: (1) MED22's role in the relationship between CT and MDD, considering genetic (GReX) and environmental (EReX) components of gene expression regulation; (2) associations between MED22 genetic variations and personality traits like neuroticism in 177 healthy volunteers; and (3) changes in MED22 expression over time in 22 MDD patients with CT undergoing trauma-focused psychotherapy, with clinical and blood assessments at baseline (T0), 4 (T4), 8 (T8), 12 (T12), and 24 weeks (T24). For the first question, in MDD patients, MED22 GReX was associated with neglect, sexual, and emotional abuse, while EReX was associated with neglect. For the second question, in healthy volunteers, MED22 SNPs were associated with higher neuroticism (Beta=0.2284; p-value=0.008), indicating reduced stress resilience. Finally, for the third question, psychotherapy improved depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) and decreased MED22 expression (F=3.05; p = 0.03), with a treatment response effect (F= 3.44; p = 0.02) at T12. Differences in MED22 expression between responders and non-responders were observed at T4 (z_value= -2.13; p = 0.040), T8 (z_value=-3.85; p = 0.0004), and T12 (z_value= -2.93; p = 0.007). Baseline transcript levels were positively associated with relapse (τ=0.390; p = 0.037) and were higher (p = 0.026) in non-remitters, suggesting potential for detecting relapse.

Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and somatic symptom disorder (SSD) are associated with quality of life (QoL) reduction. This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between these conditions as categorical diagnoses and related psychopathologies with QoL, recognizing their frequent overlap.
Methods
We recruited a total of 403 clinical patients and healthy individuals, administering diagnostic interviews based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. QoL and psychopathologies were assessed using the WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) and several self-administered questionnaires, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses examined the associations between psychiatric diagnoses, psychopathologies, and QoL.
Results
SSD and MDD were independently associated with impaired global (β = −0.318 and − 0.287) and all QoL domains (β = −0.307, −0.150, −0.125, and − 0.133, in physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains respectively for SSD; β = −0.278, −0.344, −0.275, and − 0.268 for MDD). The Beck Depression Inventory-II score showed pervasive associations with QoL (β = −0.390, −0.408, −0.685, −0.463, and − 0.420, in global, physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains). The Patient Health Questionnaire-15 and Health Anxiety Questionnaire scores were associated with global (β = −0.168 and − 0.181) and physical (β = −0.293 and − 0.121) QoL domain, while the Cognitions About Body and Health Questionnaire score was only associated with environmental QoL domain (β = −0.157).
Conclusion
SSD and MDD were independently associated with QoL impairment. Depressive symptoms were associated with all QoL domains, whereas somatic symptom burden and health anxiety primarily affected the physical QoL domain. Clinicians should consider concomitant psychopathologies when managing patients with depression, anxiety, or somatic symptoms.}

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the common depressive disorder. MDD has high comorbidity and has greater implications on quality of life. Whole system Ayurveda management protocol (WSAP) is explored for it's possible role in management of MDD.
Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of Whole system Ayurveda management protocol on Major Depressive Disorder.
Material and Methods
Study was a randomized controlled trial. Total 50 patients of MDD meeting the DSM V criteria, age group 20–70 years of either sex participated in the study. They were randomly divided into two groups, control group received Escitalopram 10 mg twice a day and Ayurveda group was on WSAP. Interventions were for 60 days. Assessments were done through various clinical parameters like Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), WHO Quality of Life- BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), Clinical Global Improvement scale (CGI), UKU Side effect scale. Assessments during intervention was on every 15th day.
Results
Study showed that Ayurveda group produced significant outcome improvement compared to control group in HDRS (p = 0.01), HARS (p = 0.03), PSQI (p = 0.03), WHOQOL-Bref (p < 0.001) and UKU side effect scale (p = 0.02). Both the group showed improvements in all the parameters except in WHOQOL-Bref where Ayurveda group only showed improvements (p < 0.001). Effect size showed large effect in WHOQOL-Bref. Mild side effects were reported in control group and none in Ayurveda group.
Conclusion
WSAP was effective in management of MDD and had better side effect profile. Further studies needed.}
